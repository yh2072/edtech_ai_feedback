Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has demonstrated significant advantages in various educational fields as it allows learners to actively learn in high interactivity and realism under their learning pace. However, for low- achieving students, VR learning environments may introduce some challenges, which are problems encountered during their learning process, which lead to difficulties in self- regulating their learning progress and becoming disoriented in the lack of guidance. This study aims to explore the improvement of self- regulated VR learning environment based on the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and enhance the performance of low- achieving students. We designed a VR course on electronic circuit hardware and programming, providing participants with a series of learning aids in the VR learning environment, including feedback, hints and guidance. Feedback aids provide correct or incorrect feedback after each task or test, guidance aids display progress following each task or test and hint aids offer guidance when inactivity is detected. A quasi- experiment was conducted by using questionnaires and practical tasks to assess the participants' cognitive levels, practical hands- on skills, self- regulated learning abilities and learning engagement after VR learning. The results demonstrated significant improvements in all learning indicators for low- achieving students.

# INTRODUCTION

Virtual Reality (VR) has gained widespread recognition and adoption in the field of education. This highly immersive learning approach, supported by advanced technology, has shown significant advantages in various learning areas. Disciplines such as science education, practical training and programming have benefited from VR applications, offering learners deeper and more intuitive learning experiences (Toyoda et al., 2022). With VR technology, learners can simulate real experimental environments, observe and analyse various phenomena in scientific experiments, thereby enhancing their cognitive processes of knowledge (Wang, Cheng, et al., 2023). Furthermore, VR is considered as an excellent tool for self- regulated learning (Radianti et al., 2020). The high interactivity and realism of VR allow learners to actively participate in and control their learning pace in content. This learning method provides learners with richer experiences, promotes deeper cognitive activities and encourages self- motivation as well as independent problem- solving skills (Zhao et al., 2023).

However, although VR has shown great potential in self- regulated learning (SRL) environments, yet this learning approach still faces many challenges that need to be addressed. In a VR learning environment, it is typically assumed that students can self- regulate and achieve good learning outcomes. However, it is not always true for all students. In fact, low- achieving students may encounter various learning difficulties in a self- regulated VR (SRVR) learning environment, especially in disciplines that require hands- on practice for learning. This is because, for students with poorer academic performance, there may be greater challenges in applying their acquired knowledge through hands- on practice to complete learning tasks. Those difficulties and challenges may compromise intrinsic advantages of VR and affect learning engagement and performance without sufficient learning strategies introduced

(Zimmerman, 2002). Even worse, they may get disoriented in the VR environment, wasting considerable time on unnecessary trial- and- error (Dalgarno & Lee, 2010). These factors may lead to them being unable to learn effectively in VR and failing to fully benefit from the advantages of VR in education. These are crucial issues that we must seriously consider and address when implementing VR technology in education. Furthermore, not all VR learning environments qualify as self- regulated (SR) learning environments. In SRVR learning environments, there must be a process of individual proactive management and control over one's learning experience. This includes setting learning goals, planning and implementing strategies to achieve these goals, monitoring progress and adjusting strategies as necessary (Sáiz- Manzanares et al., 2022). These elements of SRL can be facilitated through the design of mechanisms within the VR learning environment to realize an SRVR learning environment.

Another issue that needs to be addressed is the characteristic of highly immersive visual experiences, which may impose additional visual burdens on learners (Kavanagh et al., 2017). Particularly, learners in VR learning environments often need to face learning tasks alone, which may lead them to feel isolated and helpless. Learning without the assistance of teachers or peers can cause learners to interrupt or even give up learning, and these negative effects may be more serious in low- achieving learners (Xie et al., 2019). Therefore, when adopting VR technology to education, it is crucial to consider how to maintain its high interactivity and realism while incorporating appropriate aid mechanisms to mitigate potential negative impacts.

Despite these challenges in VR learning environments, it is still possible to optimize their learning effectiveness through effective instruction design strategies. To investigate learning effectiveness in a multimedia learning environment, Mayer (2005) proposed the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) as a theoretical foundation for adopting multimedia, such as VR, for learning. Several design principles in CTML, such as the signalling principle, the coherence principle and the segmenting principle, can guide us in designing and optimizing VR learning environments. For example, we can break learning units into smaller learning tasks and provide appropriate feedback, guidance and prompts to assist learners. Implementing such strategies can help learners avoid feeling overwhelmed or stressed and enable them to see their learning progress in a shorter period (McDaniel et al., 2009).

To address the challenges faced in SRVR learning environments, this study aims to explore VR learning environments based on the design principles provided by CTML. In light of CTML, a learning aids mechanism was designed to empower VR learning environments, including providing guidance, feedback, prompts and designing learning tasks, in order to enhance the learning of low- achieving learners in VR self- regulated learning environments. The purpose of these learning aid mechanisms is to help learners find appropriate learning directions in the VR learning environment, provide them with substantive learning feedback and then offer timely prompts to facilitate effective learning. Although some studies have explored the role of learning aid mechanisms in traditional learning environments, yet profound research on these mechanisms in VR learning environments still requires further investigation (Hite et al., 2022; Radianti et al., 2020). Additionally, current research on learning through VR has not thoroughly examined and explored the experiences of low- achieving learners in SRVR learning (Zhao et al., 2023).

Therefore, this study aims to fill this research gap by designing VR learning aids mechanism based on CTML principles and investigating their applicability and effectiveness in SRVR learning environments. We have designed a VR course on electronic circuit hardware implementation and programming, providing participants with a series of learning aid mechanisms in the VR learning environment, including feedback, hints and guidance. Furthermore, we have organized the learning units according to Bloom's taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002) and divided the VR learning units into smaller tasks to facilitate better absorption of learning

content by learners. After completing VR learning, we have also designed a practical task to assess the learners' practical hands- on skills.

Therefore, this study proposes three research questions:

1. Can the incorporation of learning aid mechanisms in VR enhance the self-regulated learning abilities of low-achieving students?  
2. Can the use of learning aid mechanisms in VR increase the engagement of low-achieving students?  
3. Can learning aid mechanisms in VR improve the cognitive levels and practical hands-on skills of low-achieving students?

# LITERATURE REVIEW

# Challenges of Virtual Reality in self-regulated learning

SRL is recognized as a learning process where learners control and manage their own learning, including setting learning goals, self- monitoring, self- assessment, time management and seeking resources (Zimmerman, 2002). VR has been considered a supportive environment for SRL as it empowers learners to set goals, self- monitor their learning progress, manage time and seek new resources. The rich and interactive learning experiences it offers are believed to enhance learners' cognitive abilities and engagement (Makransky et al., 2017). Despite the novel learning format that VR provides, some researchers believe that in SRVR environments also poses challenges. Firstly, learners in VR may feel isolated due to the lack of immediate feedback from peers and teachers, which can weaken their engagement and cognitive abilities (Makransky et al., 2019).

These challenges have a greater impact on students with lower learning achievements. This is because students who encounter various difficulties in the learning process, such as challenges in self- regulation, often exhibit lower academic achievements. Conversely, lower achievements can exacerbate these difficulties, creating a cyclical challenge in learning (Xu et al., 2022). Concerning instructional materials, these students typically require more immersive and realistic teaching resources to enhance comprehension and memory (DiFrancesca et al., 2016). On the other hand, in terms of learning methods, they often benefit more from highly interactive learning environments, which help maintain learning motivation and engagement. Additionally, given that these students might often lack sufficient SRL abilities, they necessitate more immediate and effective feedback and guidance (Moos & Ringdal, 2012). The absence of immediate and concrete feedback in VR may exacerbate their learning difficulties and potentially lead to learning abandonment (Makransky et al., 2019).

Furthermore, the high visual load of VR may distract learners' attention, leading to more time spent searching for learning resources, thereby negatively affecting their focus and learning efficiency (Makransky et al., 2019). Therefore, the SRL status of learners in VR environments requires more attention. Despite existing research on the application of SRVR learning (Mikropoulos & Natsis, 2011; Parong & Mayer, 2018; Sobocinski et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023), we still need a deeper understanding of how to provide more support for learners with lower academic achievements, and explore appropriate strategies and mechanisms to assist them in SRVR learning. For instance, some researchers have provided learning aid mechanisms in SRL environments to help low- achieving learners with memory and comprehension (Bai & Guo, 2021; Bannert, 2009; Fiorella & Mayer, 2016; Guo et al., 2019). However, the effectiveness of such approaches in VR remains unclear.

# Learning engagement in VR

Learning engagement in VRLearning engagement is a multidimensional concept, typically encompassing behavioural engagement, emotional engagement and cognitive engagement (Fredricks et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2023). In VR learning environments, this engagement is considered to have a significant impact on learning outcomes (Parong & Mayer, 2018). For typical students, the immersive nature and high interactivity of VR can provide a more comprehensive learning experience, thereby enhancing learning engagement (Huang et al., 2024; Parong & Mayer, 2018; Radianti et al., 2020). However, for students with lower learning achievements, this environment may present a series of challenges, especially when it comes to subjects in which hands- on practice is required.

Low- achieving students often encounter difficulties in SRL learning environments (Dignath et al., 2008). These challenges not only reduce their participation in SRL learning environments but may be even more pronounced in VR learning environments. Due to learners' experience in SRL- supported VR learning environments, lacking immediate teacher or peer feedback, this can further exacerbate the challenges for low- achieving students, who already struggle with SRL, in maintaining high levels of learning engagement. Furthermore, due to the often limited effective learning strategies and goal- setting abilities among low- achieving students (Merchant et al., 2014), they may be more prone to feeling lost or discouraged in a VR environment compared to their peers. This, in turn, diminishes their learning engagement.

Therefore, designing a VR learning environment that meets the needs of low- achieving students and finding ways to enhance their learning engagement and SRL abilities through appropriate teaching strategies and interventions has become an urgent and important research question (Sotiriou et al., 2020). In summary, multidimensional engagement opportunities in VR learning environments hold tremendous potential for improving learning outcomes. However, for students with lower learning achievements, there is a need to develop more effective mechanisms and strategies to support learners in their learning engagement.

# Application of CTML in optimizing VR learning environment

Application of CTML in optimizing VR learning environmentCTML provides a theoretical foundation for effectively improving and increasing learning efficiency in multimedia learning environments (Mayer, 2005). Within CTML, several important design principles are particularly relevant to this study: the signalling principle, the coherence principle and the segmenting principle. These principles are well- suited for designing learning aid mechanisms, such as feedback, guidance, hints and learning task design. The signalling principle emphasizes guiding learners' attention to essential information (Mayer & Moreno, 2003). For example, low- achieving learners, who may struggle to maintain focus on learning materials in VR environments due to their lack of self- regulation abilities, can benefit from clear visual or auditory signals in the virtual environment to help them focus on key concepts and improve learning efficiency. The coherence principle suggests presenting information using both text and visuals simultaneously to enhance learners' understanding and memory (Clark & Mayer, 2016). This principle can be applied to VR learning support's guidance mechanisms by providing visual and textual hints to assist learners in comprehending complex concepts or steps. Finally, the segmenting principle emphasizes breaking down information into smaller chunks to facilitate learners' digestion and avoid cognitive overload (Mayer, 2008). This principle can be utilized in the design of prompts or learning tasks in VR, offering learning content in a segmented or progressively sequenced manner, allowing learners to learn and understand step- by- step. This segmented or progressively sequenced

learning approach has been shown to be effective in helping low- achieving learners improve learning outcomes (Mayer et al., 2008; Scherer, 2020).

Although some studies have applied CTML in VR and other multimedia learning environments and achieved positive learning outcomes (Albus et al., 2021; Makransky et al., 2020; Wang, Lin, et al., 2023), most of these studies have focused on general learners and have not given sufficient attention to the learning conditions of low- achieving learners. Furthermore, CTML's principles have had a positive impact on many studies using multimedia as a learning tool (Albus et al., 2021; Wang, Lin, et al., 2023). In SRVR learning environments, VR learning environments need to provide learners with more rigorous and practical learning mechanisms to facilitate SRL, such as setting learning goals, planning and implementing strategies to achieve these goals, monitoring their learning progress and adjusting their strategies. Therefore, based on the solid theoretical foundation of CTML, it can offer more specific and practical guidance for SRVR learning environments. This study aims to apply CTML's design principles to SRVR learning environments to provide a more effective learning environment for low- achieving learners, with the hope of improving their learning performance.

# METHOD

# Participants

We collected data from 75  $(N = 75)$  undergraduate senior students with a background in electronic circuits. This study was approved by Human Research Ethics Committee of National Cheng Kung University. The informed consent form, which was signed by the students, stated that the data collected would be used solely for academic purposes and would not be disclosed to the public.

Based on their pretest scores, we categorized the participants' performance into the top  $33.33\%$ , the middle  $33.34\% - 66.7\%$  and the bottom  $66.7\%$ , representing high, average and low achievement levels, respectively. The experimental method used in this study employed a quasi- experimental design, with participants randomly assigned to either the control group  $(n = 37)$  or the experimental group  $(n = 38)$ . The experimental group was composed of 23 males and 15 females, whereas the control group had 21 males and 16 females. All participants were between the ages of 18 and 22, with an overall average age of 20.3  $(SD = 1.21)$ . They engaged in learning activities using VR learning environments, with one group having learning aid mechanisms and the other group without learning aid mechanisms. In the VR learning environment with learning aid mechanisms, participants received assistance messages designed in VR, while the control group received no messages with learning aid mechanisms. As dependent variables of the study, we measured participants' learning performance after completing the VR learning, which included assessing cognitive levels (remember, understand and apply), practical hands- on skills (hardware assembly and programming), SRL abilities and learning engagement. As potential covariates, we considered prior knowledge, SRL abilities and learning engagement.

# Learning materials

The topic of this study's learning material revolves around the electronic circuits course, which includes hardware assembly and programming. We divided the VR learning themes of hardware assembly and programming into three learning units based on the segmenting principle of CTML. Additionally, we designed learning aids mechanism and learning materials within the VR learning environment, in accordance with the signalling and coherence principles, as shown in Table 1.

Furthermore, we categorized these three learning units (remember, understand and apply) according to Bloom's taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002) to facilitate a progressive learning experience for the participants. The learning material includes breadboards, Raspberry Pi, IR receivers/transmitters, LEDs, resistors, jumper wires, keyboards and mice. In these learning materials, we offer learning guides that provide insights into the characteristics and utilizations of the hardware assembly and programming. These guides are designed to facilitate the learning process and enable learners to effectively utilize these resources for various tasks. Table 2 describes the descriptions and learning content of the three different learning tasks in VR.

In the experimental group's VR learning aid mechanisms, we provided three simple learning aid mechanisms. The first is the feedback aids (Figure 1), which provide participants with correct or incorrect feedback after completing an operation or test. The second is the guidance aid, where participants receive a progress panel after completing each learning task or test, showing their current progress (Figure 2). The last aid mechanism is the hint assistance, which displays prominent guiding text and images in the learning

In the practical hands- on tasks, the learning material includes physical breadboards, Raspberry Pi, IR receivers/transmitters, LEDs, resistors, jumper wires, keyboards and mice. Participants are required to correctly assemble these electronic circuit hardware components and operate them accurately through programming (Figure 4).

In practical hands- on tasks, we divided them into hardware assembly of electronic circuits and programming. Participants must complete the hardware assembly task before proceeding to the programming task.

# Questionnaires and measures

The data for this study were collected through an online questionnaire provided to the participants for completion. The pretest prior knowledge was measured by ten open- ended questions related to electronic circuits topics, developed and scored by three domain experts. The questions consisted of memory items (four questions), comprehension items (three questions) and application items (three questions). For example, 'What is the voltage of the VCC pin on the Raspberry Pi?' Each question had a maximum score of 10, with a total score of 100. The inter- rater reliability among the three independent raters was calculated  $(r = 0.89, p< 0.001)$ .

For learning cognitive levels, three domain experts jointly developed open- ended questions regarding electronic circuit hardware and programming to assess participants' posttest cognitive levels after completing VR learning. The questions were classified according to Bloom's taxonomy into four remember items (eg, 'How many types of jumper wires are there?'), three remember items (eg, 'What resistor should be used when connecting two LEDs in series?') and three apply items (eg, 'Provide an example of programming to achieve the flashing function of an LED'). The posttest was divided into three sections to better understand participants' cognitive processes during learning. Each item had a maximum score of 10, with a total score of 100.

In terms of practical hands- on tasks, the three domain experts assessed each participant's hands- on tasks, which were divided into two aspects: electronic circuit hardware assembly, including the use of correct components and accurate assembly, with a maximum score of 25 for each item, and programming, evaluating whether all components worked correctly and the successful completion of the intended functionality, with a maximum score of 25 for each item, totalling 100. The inter- rater reliability among the three domain experts was also calculated  $(r = 0.8, p< 0.001)$ .

SRL abilities was assessed using the adapted version of the SRLS (Self- Regulated Learning Strategies) developed by Pintrich and De Groot (1990). The questionnaire, which utilized a five- point scale (1 representing 'strongly disagree' and 5 representing 'strongly agree'), consisted of eight items (eg, 'I believe I can do well in assignments and tests related to electronic circuits'). The Cronbach's  $\alpha$  value for this questionnaire was 0.81.

To measure learning engagement, we utilized the participation scale developed by Reeve and Tseng (2011), comprising 17 items across three dimensions: behavioural engagement (eg, 'I am very focused when learning electronic circuits'), cognitive engagement (eg, 'When learning electronic circuits, I try to connect what I am learning to my previous experiences') and emotional engagement (eg, 'I feel curious about what I am learning in electronic circuits'). The Cronbach's  $\alpha$  values for the three dimensions were 0.803, 0.859 and 0.798, respectively.

# Procedure

All the data for this study were collected in the university setting. During the experimental process, participants were required to wear a VR Head- Mounted Display (HMD) for the learning activities, except during practical hands- on tasks. They were informed that they had the option to withdraw from the experiment at any time in case of discomfort or any other issues. It was also clarified that the learning outcomes of this experiment would not impact their academic grades or performance. The complete experimental procedure is shown in Figure 5.

First, participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Based on their pretest scores, they were categorized into high, medium and low achievement levels, and then randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. Subsequently, the researchers and assistants introduced the hardware components and devices used in VR and practical hands- on tasks to all participants. Finally, the researchers assisted the participants in wearing the HMD and helped them adjust it to a comfortable position, thus reducing the chances of experiment interruption due to discomfort caused by the HMD.

All participants were required to complete three learning units, each containing multiple learning tasks. To prevent learners from experiencing negative effects such as visual fatigue during the VR learning process, we designed the VR learning sessions based on the findings of (Souchet et al., 2023). Each learning unit was limited to 20 minutes and spread over three weeks. After completing all the learning units, participants were asked to complete a practical hands- on task related to electronic circuits, involving hardware assembly and programming. Lastly, participants filled out online questionnaires regarding their learning cognitive levels and learning engagement. Simultaneously, the researchers evaluated all participants' practical hands- on tasks.

# RESULTS

First, we used Levene's test to confirm that the homogeneity of variances was not violated for each variable (overall learning cognitive levels: High Achievers (HAs)  $(F = 2.52, p = 0.131)$ , Average Achievers (AAs)  $(F = 0.772, p = 0.391)$ , Low Achievers (LAs)  $(F = 2.63, p = 0.114)$ ; SRL: HAs  $(F = 1.86, p = 0.19)$ , AAs  $(F = 0.251, p = 0.622)$ , LAs  $(F = 0.09, p = 0.76)$ ; behavioural engagement: HAs  $(F = 0.4, p = 0.535)$ , AAs  $(F = 0.287, p = 0.598)$ , LAs  $(F = 0.263, p = 0.611)$ ; emotional engagement: HAs  $(F = 0.19, p = 0.668)$ , AAs  $(F = 0.096, p = 0.769)$ , LAs  $(F = 0.009, p = 0.922)$ ; and cognitive engagement: HAs  $(F = 0.267, p = 0.612)$ , AAs  $(F = 0.485, p = 0.495)$ , LAs  $(F = 0.465, p = 0.5)$ ). The results of the Levene's test indicated that participants' prior knowledge (pretest), SRL abilities and engagement levels all exhibited homogeneity  $(p > 0.05)$ . Subsequently, the Kruskal- Wallis test was utilized for analysis.

Table 3 displays the cognitive levels of high, average and low achieving students in the experimental and control groups, including the pretest and posttest scores for overall cognitive levels, remember, understand and apply levels. The results showed that the overall cognitive levels of all participants in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, especially for AAs and LAs  $(p< 0.001)$ . Regarding remember, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the HAs and LAs. In the understand aspect, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups only in the LAs. In terms of apply, there were significant differences between the experimental and control groups in both the AAs and LAs.

# SRL abilities and learning engagement

Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics and Kruskal- Wallis test analysis results for both groups of students, representing high, average and low achievers in terms of engagement. In terms of SRL abilities, there were significant differences among the groups, particularly for LAs. This suggests that the VR learning aid mechanisms influenced the SRL abilities of students in both the experimental and control groups, with a more pronounced impact on LAs.

Regarding behavioural engagement, the VR learning aid mechanisms had a significant effect on high, average and low- achieving students. Similarly, the VR learning aid mechanisms significantly influenced emotional engagement among high, average and low achievers. In terms of cognitive engagement, the VR learning aid mechanisms had a significant impact on high, average and low achievers. The results indicate that regardless of students' achievement levels, the VR learning environment, through the VR learning aid mechanisms, can positively affect participation.

# Practical hands-on tasks skills

The Mann- Whitney  $U$  test was employed to observe the performance of students in different groups on practical hands- on tasks. Table 5 presents the practical hands- on tasks completed by high, average and low- achieving participants in both the experimental and control groups. The results indicate significant differences between high and average achievers in both practical hands- on tasks  $(p< 0.05)$  (Figures 6 and 7). Additionally, there were significant

differences between low achievers in both tasks, and the significance level  $(p < 0.001)$  was higher than that of high and average achievers (Figure 8). The findings suggest that the VR learning environment, with its assisted mechanism, positively influenced participants' performance, regardless of their achievement levels, with a more pronounced impact on low- achieving participants.

# DISCUSSION

This study designed a VR learning environment based on CTML's signalling, segmenting and coherence principles. Additionally, a comprehensive learning aid mechanisms was integrated into the VR environment. The research aimed to analyse whether the learning aids mechanism in VR could effectively help low- achieving learners, promoting their SRL abilities, engagement, cognitive levels and practical hands- on skills.

# Effects of VR learning aids on SRL

To explore research question 1, we analysed whether the SRL abilities of students with different achievement levels in each group were influenced by the VR learning aids

mechanism. The findings of this study demonstrate that VR learning aids mechanism can significantly improve learners' SRL abilities, with particularly noteworthy effects observed among LA's and AAs learners.

Previous studies have indicated that learners with lower academic achievements might also have lower SRL abilities (Zarei Hajiabadi et al., 2023). This finding was observed in both groups of low- achieving students in our study (Tables 2 and 3). In our SRVR learning environment with aids mechanism, all students improved their SRL abilities, which aligns with the results of Zheng et al.'s (2020) study, suggesting that feedback and interactive learning environments can enhance SRL abilities. This enhancement could be related to the feedback and guidance mechanisms we designed since all participants could receive feedback on their answers or actions during learning tasks, allowing them to know whether their learning was correct. The guidance mechanism also enabled participants to monitor their learning progress at any time. Thus, even high- achieving participants, who triggered the learning aids mechanism less frequently during the learning process, still received feedback and guidance, leading to improved SRL abilities. Because in our learning units, each learning task is equipped with learning aids mechanism, although this study did not access the system and calculate the frequency of triggering the aids mechanism, it appears that higher- achieving participants typically triggered the assistance mechanisms (incorrect feedback) less frequently than lower- achieving participants when performing learning units. More importantly, for low- achieving students, the VR learning aids mechanism had a more significant impact on their SRL abilities. This finding is consistent with Tuti et al. (2021) research, which found that individuals with weaker SRL abilities require more assistance and feedback during the learning process to better understand their learning progress and, consequently, enhance their SRL abilities. Additionally, the provided prompts and aids in our study effectively helped learners focus on their learning objectives or content in the VR environment, preventing them from getting lost in the virtual world. These factors may contribute to the greater influence of the VR learning aids mechanism on the SRL of low- achieving participants. Finally, despite effectively enhancing learners' SRL abilities through aids mechanism, in actual learning processes, the strategies adopted by learners may not entirely align with these abilities. In future research utilizing these assistive tools, greater consideration should be given to such differences, especially in the learning strategies formulated through the use of different assistance mechanisms among learners with varying levels of learning achievement. For example, a more distinct differentiation between SRL abilities and strategies, proposing more specific design principles for learning assistive tools and exploring how to translate SRL abilities into effective learning strategies.

# Effects of VR learning aids on learning engagement

Regarding research question 2, we analysed the impact of VR learning aids mechanism on participants' engagement and found that the VR learning aids mechanism positively influenced the engagement of participants in all groups, regardless of their high, average or low achievement levels.

Behavioural engagement involves effort, participation and persistence (Fredricks et al., 2004). In our SRVR learning environment with learning aids mechanism, we incorporated three different types of simple aids, particularly feedback and guidance aids. These two types of aids provided participants with correct or incorrect information about their current learning progress, enabling them to self- regulate their learning strategies based on this information and think about their next steps, which may have prompted behavioural engagement. As found in the research of Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2012), self- monitoring and feedback can enhance learning engagement.

Moreover, cognitive engagement refers to the level of involvement in learning activities, such as focusing on the presented learning content. In our study, participants might have experienced increased cognitive engagement as they thought about the feedback and guidance provided by the aids mechanism. This is because they had to concentrate on the information we presented to them and retrieve relevant information from it. Finally, emotional engagement refers to participants' emotional responses to learning units or activities (Fredricks et al., 2004). In the three types of aids mechanisms we designed, participants interacted with different functionalities and were presented with rich visual elements throughout the learning process. These visual stimuli and animations may have fostered emotional engagement, which aligns with Knox's (2022) findings that rich visual animations or interactive information can promote emotional engagement. Although VR learning aids mechanism have increased learner engagement, in the future, more factors that could affect learners' engagement in learning within VR can be investigated, such as individual learning styles and prior exposure to technology.

# Effects of VR learning aids on learning cognitive levels and practical hands-on skills

To explore research question 3, we analysed learners' cognitive levels. To better understand their cognitive levels, we categorized them into remember, understand and apply levels. We then evaluated participants' performance in practical hardware hands- on tasks and programming tasks after the course to determine if these tasks were influenced by the VR learning aids mechanism. We found that in the SRVR learning environment with aids mechanism, all participants showed significant improvements in their overall cognitive levels. Particularly, the VR learning aids mechanism had the most significant impact on low- achieving participants  $(p< 0.001)$ , followed by average- achieving participants  $(p< 0.01)$  and finally, high- achieving participants  $(p< 0.05)$ . This phenomenon is consistent with several previous studies, such as Wang, Lin, et al. (2023) and Marinelli et al. (2023), which showed that providing feedback in multimedia environments can help participants enhance deeper cognitive processing. However, these studies did not explore and differentiate participants with different achievement levels. In our study, we found that the VR learning aids mechanism presented visually was more effective for low- achieving participants.

This can be explained by dividing cognitive levels into three different categories. In the remember and understand levels, the VR learning aids mechanism had a significant impact only on low- achieving participants. In our designed remember and understand tasks, we taught basic electronic circuit knowledge and logical concepts. Initially, low- achieving participants had lower levels of basic electronic circuit knowledge at the remember and understand levels compared to high and average- achieving participants. Therefore, during the learning process, low- achieving participants might have triggered more aids mechanisms to receive feedback or guidance information, which enhanced their remember and understand levels. This might be the reason why they benefited more from the aids mechanism at these levels. In the apply level, the aids mechanism only had no significant impact on high- achieving participants. In our apply task, participants needed to integrate and apply the learning content from the remember and understand tasks. However, high- achieving participants might have triggered the assistance mechanism far less frequently than average and low- achieving participants during the learning process, leading to fewer opportunities to obtain information from the aids mechanism. In contrast, other participants could gain more information from the aids mechanism. This finding is consistent with Derksen et al. (2022) research, which found that participants with low achievement or low SRL benefit more from feedback signals generated by images or text during the learning process. This

also indicates that low- achieving learners require more interactive mechanisms that provide information to facilitate their learning process.

Another result in our study indicates that the aids mechanism in the virtual environment benefits low- achieving participants more, specifically in the outcomes of both practical hands- on tasks. Although all participants' hands- on tasks were influenced by the aids mechanism, low- achieving participants showed more significant improvements.

# CONCLUSIONS

This study developed VR learning aids mechanism based on the principles of CTML and applied them to a hands- on learning environment to investigate their impact on the cognitive levels, engagement, SRL abilities and practical hands- on task skills of low- achieving participants. Compared to previous research (Albus et al., 2021; Klingenberg et al., 2020; Wang, Lin, et al., 2023), although these studies incorporated feedback or annotations in VR learning environments to enhance learners' learning outcomes, the effects on learners with different achievement levels remained unclear. Additionally, these studies did not measure participants' application of knowledge to practical hands- on tasks in the VR environment. Our research results demonstrated that introducing learning aids mechanism in the VR hands- on learning environment influenced the overall cognitive levels of all participants. Specifically, in the subcategories of remember and understand cognitive levels, the VR learning aids had the most significant impact on low- achieving participants, while in the apply level, only high- achieving participants were not influenced by the aids mechanism. In terms of engagement, the learning aids mechanism had a positive impact on participants of all achievement levels. Concerning SRL abilities, although the aids mechanism affected all participants, its impact was more pronounced among low- achieving participants. Furthermore, when measuring the outcomes of the two hands- on tasks, the results also indicated that the learning aids had a more significant effect on low- achieving participants. These findings suggest that introducing learning aids mechanism in VR can provide substantial support to low- achieving participants and effectively help them improve their cognitive levels, engagement, SRL abilities and practical hands- on skills.

This study also has some limitations. One limitation is that we did not conduct a more in- depth analysis and exploration of the usage and frequency of the designed learning aids. Although we found positive effects of these VR aids mechanism on participants, especially low- achieving ones, we did not investigate the frequency of triggering these aids or how it might affect the study variables. Therefore, we cannot determine from the experimental results how often participants of different achievement levels triggered these aids and whether these frequencies would impact the study variables. To further enrich the interpretation of our results, additional analysis could be beneficial. For example, examining the correlation between the frequency of interaction with VR learning aids and the extent of improvement in learning outcomes can provide a deeper understanding of how often students use these aids and how this involvement directly impacts their learning progress.

Another limitation of the study is the selection of the sample. This research only involved participants from one university and 75 undergraduate students, which is not suitable for broad generalization. This is especially true for target groups with low- achieving, as such a small sample size might affect the validity of the results analysis and could limit the universality of the study. Future research could explore the impact of VR learning aids in different educational settings and subjects to validate and expand our findings. Additionally, the experimental design did not consider all external variables that could influence learning outcomes, such as individual differences in cognitive style, previous exposure to VR technology or external educational support. Although we made efforts to mitigate these influences by

randomly assigning participants to control and experimental groups, these factors could still affect the effectiveness of the VR learning aids.

Nevertheless, this study still reveals that providing assistance through feedback and guidance in VR hands- on learning environments can have positive effects, especially benefiting low- achieving participants. We suggest that future VR learning environments consider incorporating visual feedback and guidance aids to assist beginners or low- achieving participants in obtaining more from VR learning. Furthermore, expanding the scope of research to encompass diverse samples, populations and topics is essential for making more extensive generalizations from these findings, thereby contributing further to the educational potential of VR learning environments. Additionally, a more in- depth exploration and analysis of the frequency and usage of aids mechanisms among participants with different achievement levels could help tailor SRVR learning environments more effectively for learners with diverse achievements.
