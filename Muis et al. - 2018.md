The purpose of this article is to delineate the role of epistemic emotions in personal epistemology and self- regulated learning (SRL). We first review important tenets of personal epistemology and SRL and then present a model of SRL that situates personal epistemology within that model. We then define epistemic emotions, describe under what conditions epistemic emotions arise, and delineate how these emotions may facilitate or constrain learning processes and learning outcomes. Specifically, we present five antecedents to epistemic emotions and five consequences of those emotions during learning. The five antecedents are control, value, novelty, complexity, and achievement or impasses of epistemic aims. The five consequences are effects on planning and goal setting, motivation, cognitive and metacognitive strategies, learning outcomes, and revisions to antecedents. We end with a discussion of educational implications and future directions for research.

Do vaccines cause autism? Is climate change real? Over the past decade, answers to these questions have become passionately debated, especially since the dawn of Web 2.0, where self- authored, unregulated content continues to grow exponentially (Kata, 2012). To illustrate, a web search (in July 2017) for information about whether vaccines are safe results in 109,000,000 hits. Unfortunately, despite the fact that  $80\%$  of Internet users search for health- related information (Kata, 2012), only  $45\%$  of sites that provide information about vaccinations contain scientifically accurate information (Kortum, Edwards, & Richard- Kortum, 2008). Even more troubling is the emotional upheaval caused by forums that present one or both sides of the vaccine debate; anxiety about making the wrong decision, anger toward the medical community, confusion about what information is accurate and who to trust, or anger toward parents who choose (not) to vaccinate (Tsuda, Muis, & Singh, 2017). As previous research has shown, emotions that arise during learning can facilitate or constrain learning processes and learning outcomes (Baker, D'Mello, Rodrigo, & Graesser, 2010).

In addition, if individuals do not have the skills to evaluate multiple perspectives, judge the veracity of information, or assess the quality of the source of information when searching online, or in any learning context, this lack of skills can have negative consequences for learning about complex issues or solving challenging problems. Within the educational context, research has shown that students rely heavily on web content for general and academic information (Metzger, Flanagin, & Zwarun, 2003). For learners to select appropriate high- quality content from which to learn, and to be able to deal with multiple conflicting viewpoints, it is critical that they develop appropriate learning skills, are able to regulate the emotions they experience during learning, and develop the ability to evaluate the epistemic aspects of new information. That is, individuals must become highly self- regulated learners and engage in high- quality epistemic cognition. Although theoretical models have been proposed that situate epistemic cognition within self- regulated learning (SRL; Greene, Muis, & Pieschl, 2010; Muis, 2007), despite calls nearly two decades ago for researchers to explore the links between emotions, personal epistemology, and learning (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Pintrich, 2002), no theoretical model has been developed to delineate how emotions may play a role in relations between personal epistemology and SRL. Given the recent explosion of research on academic emotions in educational psychology (Pekrun & Stephens, 2012), it is

paramount that theory and research on emotions are integrated into other theoretical work. As such, to fill a major theoretical gap in the current literature, the purpose of this article is to delineate the role that emotions play in personal epistemology and SRL.

We define SRL as an event that unfolds during learning that is goal directed and includes cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, affective, and social components. Personal epistemology broadly reflects the study of individuals' thinking about knowledge and knowing, which has focused primarily on epistemic beliefs- individuals' beliefs about knowledge and knowing (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). Over the past several decades, researchers theorizing about SRL (Winne & Hardwin, 1998) and personal epistemology (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Schommer, 1990) began to merge the two lines of research to evaluate the role that epistemic beliefs play in SRL. Numerous studies were conducted to explore relations between epistemic beliefs and SRL, and based on these studies, Muis (2007) developed a theoretical model that delineates how and why epistemic beliefs relate to various facets of SRL. Since then, more than 200 empirical studies have been published that explore relations between some facet of personal epistemology and SRL. We reviewed these studies to examine the role that emotions play in personal epistemology and SRL. Given the theoretical focus of this article, we do not provide a detailed review of these studies here (see Muis & Singh, 2018, for a review). Rather, we used these studies to help establish theoretical links between the constructs of interest.

We first briefly describe personal epistemology and review Muis's (2007) model that situates personal epistemology within SRL. This review is presented to establish a context for our subsequent discussion on the role of epistemic emotions within personal epistemology and SRL. Drawing from the philosophical, cognitive, developmental, and educational psychology literatures, we introduce epistemic emotions and present two propositions to delineate how they facilitate or constrain SRL. These propositions focus on the antecedents of epistemic emotions and their consequences. We then present future research directions and implications for educational practice.

# PERSONAL EPISTEMOLOGY

Over the past several decades, developmental and educational psychologists have explored individuals' thinking about knowledge and knowing. Various topics within this line of research include beliefs about knowledge, what the sources of knowledge entail, how knowledge is justified, and what constitutes truth and evidence, among many others. Since Perry's (1970) seminal work with Harvard undergraduate students, several theoretical frameworks have been established that can be delineated along two lines of complementary research: developmental frameworks e.g.Baxter Magolda,2004King & Kitchener,1994; Kuhn, 1991), and multidimensional frameworks (e.g., Hammer & Elby, 2002; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Muis, Bendixen, & Haerle, 2006; Schommer, 1990). Developmental frameworks have examined how individuals move through a patterned sequence of development, and multidimensional frameworks have considered thinking about knowledge and knowing to include multiple dimensions Hofer & Pintrich,1997;Schommer,1990).Due to space constraints, we do not review the multiple developmental and multidimensional frameworks here, as they have been fully elaborated elsewhere Greene, Sandoval, & Braten, 2016; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997).Rather, we provide an overview of the two general frameworks.

# Developmental Frameworks

Developmental Frameworks Developmental frameworks view epistemological development as a unidimensional progression through different, qualitative levels of epistemological thought. Although different labels have been used, each level can be similarly described based on Kuhn's (1991) framework. At the first stage, young children are considered direct realists wherein they view knowledge as a direct copy of reality. In the second stage, the absolutist stage, individuals view knowledge as definitively right or wrong. They believe that knowledge is objective, that it reflects the true state of the world and authority figures have all the answers. After being exposed to more conflicting paradigms, individuals move into the multiplist stage, wherein different and conflicting views are considered equally valid, that one point of view is as good as another, and all points of view are mere opinion. Finally, at the evaluativist level, individuals begin to realize that there are multiple possibilities for knowledge and that knowledge claims must be evaluated for argument quality and supporting evidence. Knowledge is considered as uncertain, but tentative conclusions are possible given a general consensus.

# Multidimensional Approaches

Multidimensional Approaches Multidimensional frameworks view thinking about knowledge and knowing as a set of multiple dimensions. Whereas some theorists view the dimensions as relatively independent (Schommer, 1990), others suggest they are more interrelated (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997) or more contextually specific epistemological resources that entail fine- grained cognitive processes that individuals use to understand and reflect on knowledge, its forms, and their stances (Elby, Macrander, & Hammer, 2016). The most prominent multidimensional framework is Hofer and Pintrich's (1997), which includes four belief dimensions about knowledge (the first two dimensions) and knowing (the last two dimensions): (a) the certainty of knowledge, which ranges from a

belief that knowledge is unchanging to evolving; (b) the simplicity of knowledge, ranging from a belief that knowledge is isolated bits and pieces of information to organized as highly related concepts; (c) the sources of knowledge, ranging from the belief that knowledge originates outside of the self and resides in experts or other authorities to a view of the self as a knower who has the ability to generate knowledge via active construction; and (d) justification for knowing, ranging from an unquestioning reliance on authorities (e.g., experts, teachers, textbook authors) to the examination, evaluation, and integration of evidence, reasons, and arguments from various perspectives to justify knowledge claims.

Moreover, epistemic beliefs are typically described as ranging from a less constructivist view of knowledge (i.e., knowledge is simple, certain, constructed by authority, and blindly accepted as true) to a more constructivist view (i.e., knowledge is complex, tentative, actively constructed, and critically evaluated). Theorists have also expanded the four dimensions to take into consideration multiple subdimensions of justification (Greene, Azevedo, & Torney- Purta, 2008) and the domain- specificity of epistemic beliefs (Muis et al., 2006). In addition to the four dimensions of epistemic beliefs, theorists have also incorporated into theoretical frameworks other constructs including epistemic motivation like need for closure (i.e., a motivational tendency or desire for an answer on a given topic to avoid confusion and ambiguity; Kruglanski, 2013), epistemic aims (i.e., goals) and values (i.e., worthiness of achieving an epistemic aim), epistemic achievements, epistemic virtues and vices, and reliable and unreliable processes for achieving epistemic aims (i.e., causal mechanisms by which one can achieve knowledge, understanding, or other epistemic aims, through various strategies; Chinn, Buckland, & Samarapungavan, 2011; Chinn & Rinehart, 2016).

Given the various constructs just delineated, Muis and Singh (2018) proposed a coherent framework to integrate the four global facets of personal epistemology that they identified: epistemic cognition, epistemic metacognition, epistemic motivation, and epistemic emotions (see Muis & Singh, 2018, for a description of the first two facets). We elaborate here the role of epistemic emotions in SRL. In the sections that follow, we first present Muis's (2007) model of SRL that incorporates personal epistemology. We then delineate the concept of epistemic emotions from various fields and describe how epistemic emotions facilitate or constrain SRL and learning outcomes.

# PERSONAL EPISTEMOLOGY IN SRL

Muis (2007) presented an integrated model that describes the role that personal epistemology plays in SRL. Like most models of SRL, she proposed four phases of learning that are recursive and weakly sequenced (Puustinen & Pulkkinen, 2001) and five areas for regulation. The four phases are (a) task definition, (b) planning and goal setting, (c) enactment, and (d) evaluation. The five areas for regulation are (a) cognition (e.g., epistemic cognition, epistemic aims), (b) motivation (e.g., epistemic value), (c) affect (e.g., epistemic emotions), (d) behavior (e.g., effort expenditure, help seeking), and (e) context (e.g., resources, instructional cues, social context). An updated version of the model is depicted in Figure 1, which includes only the internal system, but note that the external context is a very important component to take into consideration, as external components can influence the various processes and components in this model (Muis et al., 2006; Pintrich, 2000).

In the first phase of learning, an individual constructs a perception of the task, which can be influenced by the five areas for regulation (context, behavior, cognition, motivation, and affect; Muis & Franco, 2009). During the second phase, components that are activated during the first phase, like epistemic beliefs, influence the types of goals an individual sets for learning and the plans made for carrying out the task (Muis & Franco, 2009). A goal is modeled as a multifaceted profile of information (e.g., depth of understanding; Butler & Winne, 1995), and each standard in the profile is used as a basis to compare the products created when engaged in the activity. The product is compared to the goal's criteria via metacognitive monitoring. Planning includes selecting the types of learning strategies to carry out the task, identifying the type of information on which to focus during learning, and determining the extent to which the veracity of information should be evaluated.

The third phase begins when an individual carries out the task by enacting the chosen epistemic or learning strategies (Richter & Schmid, 2010). Information that can serve as feedback is generated during this phase and copied into working memory (Butler & Winne, 1995). This information may then be used during the last phase of learning. In the last phase, individuals may evaluate the successes or failures of each phase, products created for the task, and/or perceptions about the self or context (e.g., "How do I know this?"; Hofer, 2004). To illustrate, if the learner monitors the products created at each step in relation to the goal

FIGURE 1 An integrated model of epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning.

profile, internal feedback is generated (e.g., "Do I have evidence to support this claim?"; Hofer, 2004). This feedback can be used to judge whether the goals have been achieved; if not, information produced from monitoring may be used to adjust or redefine facets of the previous phases. As such, key to the evaluation phase is metacognition, but metacognitive processes occur during all phases of SRL. That is, monitoring and control are ongoing throughout the learning process, and goals and plans may also change or be updated as feedback about progress becomes available. Moreover, products created across all four phases can feed into other phases, reflecting the cyclical nature of SRL.

Based on the model just described, Figure 1 can be elaborated. The cognitive, motivational, and affective conditions of a task (e.g., epistemic beliefs, knowledge about strategies) directly and indirectly affect the epistemic aims, other goals, and plans to achieve those goals via specific learning strategies, as shown by the arrows from components in Phase 1 to the components in Phase 2. The reciprocal arrows between each of the components in Phase 1 suggest that they may also directly influence one another or interact to predict the goals, epistemic aims, and plans set in Phase 2. The epistemic aims, goals, and plans that learners set for the task directly predict the types of epistemic and other strategies that learners implement during learning (Phase 3). Strategies implemented during Phase 3 directly influence the products created during learning. Phase 4 is considered the evaluation phase of learning wherein metacognition is key. Metacognitive processes occur during each phase of SRL, and information elicited during metacognitive processing can feed back into the various phases, as indicated by the arrows that feed each phase from Phase 4. Finally, the last arrow from SRL to learning achievement indicates that all components from within the internal and external systems interact to influence learning achievement. In what follows, we describe epistemic emotions and elaborate how they interact with other components of SRL to affect the various processes and products.

# EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

Today, various emotions are recognized as critical to students' learning, motivation, and academic performance (Pekrun & Linnenbrink- Garcia, 2014). Emotion theorists define emotions as multifaceted phenomena that include affective, cognitive, motivational, physiological, and expressive processes (Scherer, 2000). To illustrate, the anxiety that students experience about an upcoming performance may

consist of feelings of uneasiness (affective), worry about the performance (cognitive), desire to get away from the situation (motivation), increased heart rate and sweaty palms (physiological), and nervous facial expression (expressive; Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). As recent research has shown, positive emotional experiences, such as joy and hope, may improve learning outcomes (Pekrun, Ellis, & Maier, 2009). However, some studies have demonstrated that positive emotions have no effect (Trevors, Muis, Pekrun, Sinatra, & Winne, 2016), or even negative effects on learning outcomes (Ellis, Seibert, & Varner, 1995), particularly when positive emotions draw attentional resources away from the task at hand (Meinhardt & Pekrun, 2003). Negative emotional experiences, like frustration and boredom, typically constrain learning outcomes (Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfield, & Perry, 2011) but have also been shown to relate to positive learning outcomes (Muis, Psaradellis, Lajoie, Di Leo, & Chevrier, 2015). Both positive and negative emotions have also been shown to predict self- regulatory processes, like strategy use and motivation (Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015; Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015; Op't Eynde, De Corte, & Verschaffel, 2007).

Given the role that emotions play in learning, several theoretical frameworks in the field of education have been developed to delineate the antecedents and consequences of students' emotional experiences during achievement situations. One prominent theoretical framework is Pekrun's (2006; Pekrun & Perry, 2014) control- value theory of achievement emotions. Achievement emotions are defined as "emotions that are tied directly to achievement activities or achievement outcomes" (Pekrun, 2006, p. 317). Activity emotions occur during engagement in an activity, whereas outcome emotions include prospective outcome emotions, related to possible future successes or failures, and retrospective outcome emotions, linked to previous successes and failures. Activity and outcome emotions that occur during achievement situations are thus part of the broader category of achievement emotions. In addition, achievement emotions may occur in academic situations but may also occur in other settings. As such, achievement emotions are considered distinct from yet overlap with academic emotions (Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). Moreover, within the broader category of academic emotions, the type of emotion that arises is labeled according to arousal (activating vs. deactivating), valence (positive vs. negative), and object focus (e.g., achievement emotions, topic emotions, epistemic emotions). Although research on emotions has become prominent in the broader educational literature, only recently have researchers taken into consideration the role that object- focused emotions, or more specifically epistemic emotions, play in learning (Pekrun & Stephens, 2012).

We define epistemic emotions as emotions that result from information- oriented appraisals (i.e., the cognitive component of an emotion) about the alignment or misalignment between new information and existing beliefs, existing knowledge structures, or recently processed information. Individuals may experience joy when information is consistent with or verifies their prior knowledge or epistemic beliefs (Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015). They may experience anxiety, anger, or frustration when the information presented is inconsistent with their prior knowledge or includes epistemic views (e.g., knowledge is not certain) that are counter to their epistemic beliefs (e.g., knowledge is certain; Bendixen, 2002; Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015). Individuals may also experience surprise, curiosity, and confusion when incoming information is inconsistent with prior knowledge (D'Mello & Grasser, 2012), epistemic beliefs (Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015), or recently processed information (Kang et al., 2009). Thus, epistemic emotions may arise when there are inconsistencies or other discrepancies in processing the information that cause cognitive disequilibrium (D'Mello, Lehman, Pekrun, & Graesser, 2014), or when there are consistencies that cause cognitive equilibrium (Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015). Other experiences, such as feelings of uncertainty, may trigger curiosity if an individual judges that the effort required to resolve the uncertainty is not too great (Foster & Keane, 2015) or may trigger anxiety or anger in individuals driven by a high need for closure (Lilman, 2005). Emotions may also arise when an epistemic aim is strived for, blocked, or achieved. Under these conditions, the object focus may not be epistemic, and as such, these emotions may best be described as emotions that occur in epistemically related contexts (see also Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017). To illustrate, emotions may arise when an individual sets the epistemic aim to understand something. When the goal is achieved, he or she may experience joy in achieving that aim. However, when an epistemic aim is blocked, that individual may experience anxiety, frustration, or anger.

From a philosophical perspective, epistemic emotions have become a popular line of discussion since the 1990s (Brun & Kuenzie, 2008). Philosophers have argued for views of inquiry to include conceptions of understanding, which also include consideration of values, rules, categories, and methods that are epistemically evaluated and tied directly to epistemic emotions (Goodman, & Elgin, 1988). Given the direct tie between epistemic emotions and other epistemic processes (Thagard, 2000, 2008), philosophical theories of emotions have taken into consideration their cognitive significance (Arango- Munoz & Michaelian, 2014; de Sousa, 2008; Dokic, 2012). Drawing on work from cognitive (Lazaurus, 1999) and cross- cultural (Ekman, 1999) psychology, philosophers have defined epistemic

emotions as multicomponential constructs that can be characterized by their valence, arousal, and object focus. They suggest that there are emotions with an object focus that can only ever be epistemic, including surprise, curiosity, and confusion (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008). Philosophers propose that surprise involves the supposition that what has happened conflicts with prior knowledge, expectation, or beliefs (Scheffler, 1977). Curiosity occurs when there is a desire to learn what is unknown, which is driven by an incongruity or information gap between what one knows and what one wants to know (Loewenstein, 1994). Confusion is defined as arising from appraisals of uncertainty stemming from novelty, complexity, conflict, or unfamiliarity (Ellsworth, 2003).

In addition, as philosophers argue, other emotions may be considered epistemic as well. Epistemic anxiety is defined as a form of doubt or uncertainty about one's beliefs in a proposition (Hookaway, 2008). When an individual begins to doubt a proposition, that individual evaluates the belief as "epistemically unsafe," as something that would be rash to believe on the basis of the reasons he or she currently possesses. Epistemic joy reflects the emotion one experiences when verification is achieved, or as the criteria for successful validation of inductively achieved hypotheses (Brun & Kuenzel, 2008). As Schlick (1934) pointedly stated, "The joy in knowledge is joy in verification, the exaltation of having guessed correctly" (pp. 382- 383). Of course, when verification is denied, epistemic frustration or anger may ensue.

Philosophers have also proposed five functions of epistemic emotions (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008) that may arise during different phases of inquiry (de Sousa, 2008): (a) motivational force, (b) salience and relevance, (c) epistemic access to facts and beliefs, (d) nonpropositional contributions to knowledge and understanding (e.g., knowledge through direct awareness; see Murphy, Alexander, & Muis, 2012), and (e) epistemic efficiency (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008). First, epistemic emotions can motivate individuals to engage in more cognitive activities, such as inquiry processes, when one is frustrated with an epistemic outcome, or to reevaluate one's epistemic standards in the case of doubt or anxiety about an epistemic outcome. Epistemic emotions also serve to provide salience by narrowing one's focus and increasing one's attention to a certain aspect of a situation. If something is surprising, then an individual's attention is drawn to what caused the surprise (Peters, 2006). A third function of epistemic emotions is based on the claim that emotions serve as access to an additional source of knowledge, alongside reason, testimony, perception, and intuition (Elgin, 2008). To illustrate, if an object is claimed to be disgusting, and an individual experiences disgust when exposed to that object, then her emotion provides justification for that claim. The properties of these objects are then said to be response dependent (Johnston, 1989). That is, if individuals are not disgusted by an object, then the object cannot be categorized as disgusting. The notion of affect- as- information has also been put forth by Schwarz and Clore (1983), who assumed that emotional reactions provide useful feedback about the target of emotional appraisal processes. Further, work by Tiedens and Linton (2001) suggests that emotions can serve as information about the state of certainty: Emotions accompanied by a feeling of certainty or uncertainty were related to appraisal- congruent judgments in subsequent situations. For instance, emotions associated with certainty, such as anger and happiness, were found to be linked to a greater reliance on expertise as a source of knowledge and less thorough processing of information in a subsequent writing task. Inversely, emotions associated with uncertainty, such as surprise or sadness, were found to be related to more systematic processing, including a more thorough treatment of information and a greater attention to the quality of arguments over the source's characteristics.

Fourth, and related to the third point, epistemic emotions can contribute significantly to the formation of categories and cognitive organization, as well as standards of inquiry and justification (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008). For categories, Elgin (1996) argued that the application of new categories, or the abandonment of pointless categories, are best tied to emotions. To illustrate, if two situations are seemingly outrageous, then this can count as evidence against a proposed system of categories. For conceptual organization, as noted in the third function, emotional responses constitute response- dependent properties of objects (e.g., amusing, boring, interesting, disgusting), which affect conceptual organization of those objects. For standards of inquiry and justification, Thagard (2008) proposed a theory of coherence wherein judgments about coherence of human thought and action are connected to emotional reactions on a neurological level; in other words, there is a causal connection between coherence and epistemic emotions. Specifically, Thagard argued that beliefs, desires, and emotions should be construed as brain mechanisms rather than as propositional attitudes. Given that mental states are patterns of neural activity, then cognition and emotion are intertwined. In his neuro- computational theory of emotional consciousness (Thagard & Aubie, 2008), Thagard delineated each of the brain areas responsible for emotion and demonstrated their overlap with main areas relevant to somatic and cognitive processing. Given these overlaps, Thagard proposed that emotions are linked with cognition, thereby demonstrating how emotions can be integral to epistemology. In other words, if coherence is accepted as a standard for assessing theories, then one could argue that such causal connections warrant the claim that emotions also are relevant to the evaluation of a theory because they can be interpreted as indicators of coherence (or incoherence).

Finally, philosophers have proposed two ways in which epistemic emotions contribute to cognitive efficiency: They make it easier to process information, and certain cognitive

functions cannot be performed successfully without them. de Sousa (2008) claimed that epistemic emotions make rational deliberation possible by making relevant information salient. Indeed, epistemic efficiency is a by- product of epistemic emotions when they increase the salience of particular information and serve as information about the target of some evaluative process.

In the next section, building from these philosophical positions, we present two additional propositions with regard to the role that epistemic emotions play in personal epistemology and SRL. Our propositions are supported by research from the fields of developmental, cognitive, and educational psychology.

# EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS AND SELF-REGULATED LEARNING

# Proposition 1: There Are Five Antecedents to Epistemic Emotions That Can Be Activated Throughout the Phases of SRL

Recall that epistemic emotions are defined as emotions that arise out of information- oriented appraisals about the alignment or misalignment between new information and existing beliefs, existing knowledge structures, or recently processed information. Epistemically related emotions are defined as emotions that arise out of information- oriented appraisals about whether an epistemic aim has been achieved or blocked. We propose five information- oriented appraisals that can act as antecedents to epistemic emotions: (a) control, or appraisals that pertain to the controllability of epistemic- related actions (action control; see Pekrun, 2006), and outcomes (outcome control), such as perceptions about one's capacity to understand; (b) value, or appraisals that pertain to the subjective importance of these epistemic activities and outcomes, which can relate to the intrinsic values of the activity itself or the extrinsic, instrumental values (Pekrun & Stephens, 2012); (c) novelty of information when contrasted with prior knowledge, recently processed information, or individuals' epistemic beliefs; (d) complexity of information; and (e) the achievement or impasse of an epistemic aim. We describe each of them in turn.

Control and value. During Phase 1 of SRL, perceptions of the task, context, beliefs about the self, and knowledge of the task are activated including perceptions of control, task value, epistemic beliefs, achievement goals, outcome expectations, and intrinsic interest (Muis, 2007; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman & Labuhn, 2012; see Figure 1). Building from this, and following Pekrun's (2006) control- value theory of achievement emotions, we propose that when learners' schemas for a task are activated, their perceptions of control and value are also activated and interact to predict the epistemic emotions that learners experience during task engagement. Once an individual begins to form a perception about a task, he or she will develop a sense of action control for carrying out the task (e.g., whether one can successfully provide support for claims made, provide justifications, understand the material, or weigh multiple perspectives; Trevors et al., 2016) and will assess the epistemic value of the content or achieving specific epistemic aims (e.g., "Is it important that I understand what I am learning?"). To illustrate, if perceived control is low but value is high, learners are likely to experience epistemic anxiety when they doubt a proposition. In contrast, if both control and value are high, learners are more likely to experience epistemic joy when a proposition is consistent with their prior knowledge. Conversely, if both are low, individuals are more likely to experience epistemic boredom (Pekrun & Stephens, 2012).

Results from research provide support for these two antecedents to epistemic emotions (e.g., Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015; Pekrun et al., 2017). Muis, Psaradellis, et al. (2015) examined whether interactions between perceived control for carrying out a complex mathematics problem and value for that task served as antecedents to the epistemic emotions elementary students experienced during complex mathematics problem solving. Two critical aspects of the problem were that students had to provide support for their approaches and justify their solutions. As such, perceptions of control and value tapped into important epistemic aspects of the problem- solving process. Of particular interest, path analyses revealed that both control and value were direct and moderate predictors of epistemic emotions. Specifically, higher levels of perceived control were related to lower levels of confusion and anxiety, and higher levels of value were related to higher levels of curiosity and joy, as well as lower levels of confusion, frustration, anxiety, and boredom.

Novelty and complexity. The vast majority of research within the developmental, cognitive, and educational psychology literatures has focused on novelty as the primary antecedent to epistemic emotions. During learning, an individual may perceive incoming information as new, novel, or unique. This information may trigger surprise if that information is unexpected (Foster & Keane, 2015). Research on surprise has typically been divided into two lines of research—the probability approach (i.e., the probability of an event occurring, disconfirming expectations, scheme- discrepant events, or events of contrasting probabilities; Reisenzein & Studtmann, 2007) and the sense- making approach, which stresses the importance of understanding and integrating the surprising event into current knowledge structures (Foster & Keane, 2015).

Within the probability approach, discrepant events, or events that cause cognitive disequilibrium, have also been explored as antecedents to epistemic emotions. D'Mello and Graesser (2012) proposed a model of affect dynamics

to delineate when epistemic emotions arise during the enactment phase of learning. They argued that cognitive disequilibrium plays a critical role, which they defined as a state of uncertainty that occurs when an individual is confronted with interruptions to organized action sequences, impasses, contradictions, anomalous events, dissonance, incongruities, unexpected feedback, or uncertainty. The significance of cognitive disequilibrium in learning and problem solving has had a long history across the various disciplines just noted (Berlyne, 1954; Festinger, 1957; Piaget, 1952), and the emotions that arise from cognitive disequilibrium have simultaneously been investigated for a similar period (Festinger, 1957; Lazarus, 1991).

Although D'Mello and Graesser (2012) focus primarily on confusion, frustration, and boredom, others have focused on curiosity (Litman, 2005; Silvia, 2010), surprise (Foster & Keane, 2015), joy and anxiety (Chevrier, Muis, Trevors, Pekrun, & Sinatra, 2015; D'Mello & Graesser, 2011; Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015; Muis, Psaradelis, et al., 2015). For simplicity and brevity, we focus on the seven epistemic emotions that have received the most theoretical and empirical attention: surprise, curiosity, joy, confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom (see D'Mello & Graesser, 2011). As noted earlier, Foster and Keane (2015) described surprise as a reaction to something that is unexpected. Loewenstein (1994) described curiosity as arising from an incongruity, or information gap—a discrepancy between what one knows and what one wants to know. Finally, Ellsworth (2003) defined confusion as arising from appraisals of uncertainty stemming from novelty, complexity, conflict, or unfamiliarity.

Indeed, as D'Mello et al. (2014) proposed, complexity is a key antecedent to confusion during engagement in complex learning tasks. Complex learning tasks may include comprehending difficult texts, solving complex mathematics problems, generating cohesive arguments, or modeling complex systems. These kinds of tasks require learners to generate inferences, answer causal questions, diagnose and solve problems, or demonstrate application and transfer of acquired knowledge (Graesser, Ozuru, & Sullins, 2010). As D'Mello et al. argued, confusion is unavoidable during complex learning tasks. As researchers have reported, confusion is the most (Di Leo, Muis, & Singh, 2017; Lehman, D'Mello, & Person, 2010) or second most frequent emotion experienced during complex learning (see D'Mello, 2013, for a meta- analysis of the emotions literature). Moreover, D'Mello and Graesser (2011, 2012) argued that confusion results in joy when the impasse is resolved, or in frustration and boredom when resolution is not achieved and confusion is prolonged.

Within the context of our model, we propose four conditions under which epistemic emotions are triggered via novelty due to new or (in)congruent information: when incoming information is (a) new and unexpected, (b) inconsistent with prior knowledge, (c) inconsistent with recently processed information, or (d) counter to or consistent with one's epistemic beliefs (Chevrier et al., 2015). Under any of these conditions, when new or discrepant information is detected, surprise is likely the first emotion to occur (Chevrier et al., 2015; D'Mello & Graesser, 2012), attention shifts to the discrepant information, and the autonomic nervous system is aroused (Stein & Levine, 1991). At this point, the intensity of surprise that learners experience depends on their perception, or metacognitive estimate, of the amount of cognitive work involved in explaining the surprising event (Foster & Keane, 2015). As Foster and Keane (2015) suggested, some surprises may be more surprising than others because they are more difficult to explain. It may also be the case, however, that the level of surprise is a function of the level of novelty of the information. Either way, we suggest that when the experience of surprise is perceived as low, learners will continue to engage in learning without changing their course of action (i.e., no change of strategies occurs). However, when the level of intensity is high, Silvia (2010) proposed that one of two emotions is likely to occur next: curiosity following an appraisal of high comprehensibility, or confusion following an appraisal of low comprehensibility. As such, surprise is construed as a neutral emotion given that it may result in a negative or positive appraisal depending on the context (Foster & Keane, 2015; Maguire, Maguire, & Keane, 2011).

With regard to complexity as an antecedent to epistemic emotions, following Silvia (2010), we argue that complexity of the task or information will also predict whether curiosity or confusion follows surprise after novel or incongruent events. That is, when complexity of the task or information is low, curiosity will more likely follow surprise rather than confusion. However, when complexity is high, confusion is more likely to occur following surprise. Complexity of a task or information may also trigger epistemic emotions under conditions that do not involve novel information or incongruity. When information is complex, individuals may experience anxiety or confusion when they do not understand an aspect of the task or information. If confusion persists, this may transition into frustration or boredom (D'Mello & Graesser, 2011, 2012). Alternatively, individuals may experience joy if understanding is achieved.

Empirical studies support these propositions. Silvia (2010) examined the appraisal space between confusion and curiosity by having individuals rate their levels of curiosity and confusion in addition to novelty, complexity, and comprehensibility across a series of images. Results revealed that images that were rated as highly curiosity provoking were also rated as complex and comprehensible, whereas images that were rated as highly confusing were also rated as highly complex but incomprehensible. Given these results, Silvia concluded that appraisals of curiosity and confusion are similar but that curiosity arises as a function of information being highly novel, complex, but

comprehensible, whereas confusion results from high novelty, complexity, and incomprehensibility.

With regard to epistemic beliefs, in their theoretical framework linking epistemic beliefs to epistemic emotions, Muis, Pekrun, et al. (2015) proposed that when individuals' epistemic beliefs align with the epistemic nature of the learning task or content (i.e., how knowledge is presented for a particular task, like being stated in certain vs. tentative terms), cognitive congruity will occur. Under this condition, their beliefs will positively predict positive epistemic emotions, such as joy and curiosity, and negatively predict negative epistemic emotions, such as confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom. In contrast, when individuals' epistemic beliefs do not align with the epistemic nature of the learning task or content (i.e., cognitive incongruity occurs), their epistemic beliefs will negatively predict positive emotions and positively predict negative emotions and surprise, given the cognitive incongruity. To illustrate, if individuals believe that knowledge about climate change is certain with regard to the causes of climate change but are given information from multiple experts that include disagreements regarding causes of climate change, then this incongruity between beliefs and the content should trigger epistemic emotions.

Across two studies, Muis, Pekrun, et al. (2015) found support for their hypotheses. They found that epistemic beliefs served as antecedents to the epistemic emotions that individuals experienced during learning. Specifically, path analyses revealed that individuals who believed that the justification of knowledge about climate change requires critical evaluation of multiple sources experienced higher levels of joy and curiosity and lower levels of boredom when confronted with conflicting information. A belief in the complexity of knowledge about climate change was related to lower levels of confusion, anxiety, and boredom. Finally, a belief in the uncertainty of climate change knowledge predicted lower levels of anxiety and frustration, and a belief in the active construction of knowledge predicted lower levels of confusion.

In another study, Chevrier et al. (2015) employed a think aloud protocol to capture epistemic emotions during learning of complex content and to empirically assess whether they are triggered via incoming information that is novel or inconsistent with prior knowledge, inconsistent with recently processed information, or counter to or consistent with one's epistemic beliefs. For surprise and confusion, nearly  $90\%$  of all instances were a function of an information gap, whereas the other  $10\%$  were due to a discrepancy between the information and individuals' epistemic beliefs. Similarly, for curiosity,  $68\%$  were a function of an information gap, whereas the other  $32\%$  were a function of congruence between the information and one's epistemic beliefs. Of interest, all  $(100\%)$  instances of frustration were due to a discrepancy between information and one's epistemic beliefs. Last, for joy,  $71.42\%$  were instances of an information gap, whereas  $29\%$  resulted from an epistemic aim being achieved.

Building from these findings, we propose several conditions under which curiosity or confusion may follow surprise, which take into consideration four dimensions that may interact: novelty of information, complexity of information, capacity to understand (i.e., ability based on prior knowledge and skills), and value of information. For example, as depicted in Figure 2, when novelty and value are high and individuals' capacity to understand exceeds complexity, they will experience curiosity following surprise. If, however, complexity exceeds capacity but novelty and value are still high, then individuals will experience confusion following surprise. For the dimension of complexity coupled with high novelty, curiosity will follow surprise when capacity to understand exceeds complexity, but confusion will follow surprise when complexity exceeds capacity to understand. However, individuals may be presented with information that is highly novel, but due to low perceived value those individuals may not experience curiosity even when capacity exceeds complexity.

Under the condition when complexity exceeds capacity and value is high, if confusion is not resolved, this may lead to anxiety or frustration and possibly boredom if confusion persists (D'Mello & Graesser, 2012). Boredom may also arise under conditions of low value, low complexity, low capacity, or when capacity exceeds task demands (i.e., underchallenged). In addition, if confusion is resolved, individuals may subsequently experience joy or relief (D'Mello & Graesser, 2012). Finally, it is also plausible that curiosity and confusion may arise without surprise as an antecedent, as curiosity or confusion need not always follow surprise (Chevrier et al., 2015). When individuals begin to read, they may simply be curious about the information they are reading without necessarily being surprised by that information. Individuals may also be surprised by information but continue to read without a subsequent emotional experience (Chevrier et al., 2015). Under this condition, the novelty of the information may not be sufficiently high to trigger subsequent epistemic emotions.

As such, we propose a loosely sequenced three- step process in the activation of epistemic emotions. In the first step, new information is appraised in terms of novelty with prior information and beliefs. If novelty is sufficiently high, then this will trigger surprise. In the second step following surprise, the information is appraised in terms of complexity, capacity, and value, which will determine whether surprise transitions into curiosity or confusion. At the third step, the epistemic emotions that are triggered in the second step will signal to the learner something about their rate of progress toward meeting their epistemic aim. Confusion from the second step may further transition into anxiety, frustration, or boredom, especially under conditions where uncertainty continues. In contrast, curiosity may transition into feelings of certainty or insight, which may then result in joy. If, however, confusion is resolved, this may then transition into joy. We elaborate on this next.

FIGURE 2 An appraisal space for epistemic emotions.

Achievement or impasse of an epistemic aim. Zimmerman and Labuhn (2012) proposed that during the forethought phase (labeled Phase 2 in our model), individuals set goals for learning. Once products are created, individuals evaluate those products against some standard, such as their own previous performance, another person's performance, or internal standards that individuals set for their current performance. We argue that products created during learning are compared against the standards derived from epistemic aims as well as other standards set for the task. This is accomplished through metacognitive monitoring (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; Hofer, 2004). When individuals evaluate products against set standards via metacognitive monitoring, emotions may arise. To illustrate, if an individual sets an epistemic aim to understand a complex construct, and is able to explain that construct and transfer understanding to a new problem situation, then the individual may experience joy in achieving that epistemic aim.

Goal appraisal theories of emotions (e.g., Silvia, 2010; Stein & Levine, 1991) suggest that individuals can enter a state of flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) or engagement when they are pursuing goals such as understanding the material. When they are deeply engaged in learning the material, they attempt to assimilate information into current knowledge structures. Being in a state of flow may signal to individuals that they are progressing toward a goal, which may lead to joy. However, when a goal is blocked, the learner may experience surprise, confusion, frustration, or anxiety, depending on the context (Silvia, 2010). A learner may then set a subgoal to resolve the impasse. When positive feedback is received that the goal is no longer blocked, or that subgoal is achieved, the learner may experience joy. However, if the impasse cannot be resolved, the learner may experience frustration or hopeless confusion, which may then lead to boredom (disengagement; D'Mello & Graesser, 2011, 2012).

A number of studies have demonstrated that learners experience surprise (Inaker et al., 2010; D'Mello & Graesser, 2011) or joy when an epistemic aim is achieved (Chevrier et al., 2015; Di Leo & Muis, 2015), or surprise, confusion, or frustration when an epistemic aim is blocked or not achieved (D'Mello et al., 2014). Others have also suggested that epistemic emotions may arise when other judgments of learning occur (Arango- Munoz & Michaelian, 2014), including feelings of uncertainty, which may trigger confusion or anxiety (Dokic, 2012), and feelings of understanding and feelings of knowing, which trigger joy (Dokic, 2012; Whittlesea & Williams, 2000). For example, D'Mello and Graesser (2012) examined the dynamics of affective states during learning of complex content over two studies. Results revealed that when participants' goals were blocked, they transitioned from a state of flow to confusion,

and when subgoals to address the impasse were achieved, participants returned back to a state of flow. In contrast, when participants' goals were blocked and were not able to resolve the impasse, participants transitioned from states of flow to confusion to frustration. In addition, for Study 2 they found that of the participants who moved from confusion to frustration, those who were able to resolve the impasse after prolonged periods of effort returned to a state of flow. Based on these results, D'Mello and Graesser (2012) highlighted the importance of goal appraisal and impasse resolution during learning and problem solving. They found that complex learning is replete with epistemic affective experiences that can facilitate or constrain learning. Indeed, the majority of research that has explored the role of epistemic emotions in learning has focused on emotions' relations to learning processes and learning outcomes. We elaborate this proposition following a brief discussion of the five antecedents just described.

# Brief Discussion

Taken together, results from the studies just presented provide support for the proposition that control, value, novelty, complexity, and achievement (or impasses) of epistemic aims predict the epistemic emotions individuals experience during learning. Individuals who espouse more constructivist epistemic beliefs are more likely to experience positive epistemic emotions and less likely to experience negative epistemic emotions given the alignment between their beliefs and the epistemic nature of the incoming information. However, individuals' perceptions of control and value should also be taken into consideration. Because an individual espouses more constructivist beliefs does not necessarily mean he or she will experience more positive epistemic emotions. If an individual assigns little value to the task, then he or she may experience higher levels of frustration, anger, or boredom if the task is a required one (Goetz et al., 2014), regardless of their epistemic beliefs. That is, even if an individual espouses more constructivist beliefs about knowledge of a particularly complex topic, under conditions of cognitive congruity, if they do not value learning about that topic, then value may be more predictive of the epistemic emotions they experience during learning compared to their epistemic beliefs.

It is also plausible that epistemic beliefs interact with perceptions of control and value to predict epistemic emotions. To illustrate, an individual may highly value learning about a specific topic and espouse less constructivist beliefs about that topic. When confronted with incongruent information that severely threatens his or her epistemic beliefs, that individual may experience higher levels of anxiety compared to an individual with the same beliefs but lower value. Even when individuals perceive a high sense of control and value, their less constructivist epistemic beliefs may lead them to experience confusion, frustration, or anger given the incongruity between the epistemic nature of the content and their own epistemic beliefs. Future research is needed to explore these potential relations. In summary, antecedents to epistemic emotions that may arise during learning may be activated during the task definition phase of learning (i.e., control, value, epistemic beliefs), or during any phase with information- oriented appraisals.

Of course, epistemic emotions can also arise during the task definition phase of SRL, and not just during the enactment or evaluation phases (e.g., "Oh, I am curious about what the authors have to say"; Chevrier et al., 2015). That is, during task definition, individuals may carry out an initial appraisal of the learning situation, which may give rise to epistemic emotions (Lazarus, 1991). These emotions may then predict subsequent courses of action that individuals take (or abandon) during learning. As such, regardless of when epistemic emotions arise, they have consequences for SRL, which we describe in our second proposition.

# Proposition 2: There Are Five Consequences of Epistemic Emotions That Can Facilitate or Constrain SRL

Given that epistemic emotions may be activated during any phase of SRL, they can subsequently affect any phase. As Pekrun (2006) proposed, once emotions are experienced, they predict individuals' learning processes and achievement via mechanisms such as cognitive and metacognitive strategies, and motivation. In addition, because SRL is cyclical and recursive (Muis, 2007), it is also plausible that epistemic emotions affect change in their antecedents. As such, epistemic emotions can facilitate or constrain SRL via their effect on (a) planning and goal setting; (b) motivation; (c) cognitive and metacognitive strategies; (d) learning outcomes; and (e) revisions to control, value, and epistemic beliefs. We delineate these consequences in turn, beginning with planning and goal setting.

Planning and goal setting. If epistemic emotions have been activated during Phase 1, or later during other phases, they can predict the epistemic aims or other goals that learners set for the task. To illustrate, during task definition, if a learner begins to read a complex mathematics problem and experiences confusion when attempting to figure out the parameters of the problem, the learner may not feel confident that he or she can provide a clear justification for the approach taken. Alternatively, an individual may experience epistemic anxiety due to a feeling of uncertainty about the content and, as such, set epistemic aims that are easier to achieve. As another example, if an

individual is learning about complex, contradictory content about genetically modified foods and has a rich prior knowledge base, he or she may be curious to learn more and may feel confident that a full understanding of the new content is an achievable epistemic aim.

Accordingly, epistemic emotions that learners experience when they begin to form a definition of a task may provide cues to learners that particular goals may or may not be achievable. Individuals may then adjust goals as a function of those cues (downgrading or upgrading). Of course, epistemic emotions that arise during the enactment or evaluation phases may subsequently lead learners to revise previous goals. For example, as a learner progresses in a task and achieves one of the epistemic aims, he or she may revise that goal and set the standard even higher than the original. In addition, epistemic emotions may serve as cues to learners to set particular plans for carrying out the task. If a learner experiences confusion surrounding the parameters of a mathematics problem, that individual may then plan to construct a concept map of that problem and coordinate informational sources between the problem text and the concept map to reduce confusion (Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015).

A number of studies support this proposition (Baker et al., 2010; Chevrier et al., 2015; D'Mello et al., 2014; Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015; Whittlesea & Williams, 2000). Muis, Psaradellis, et al. (2015) examined relations between perceptions of control and value, epistemic emotions, self- regulatory processes (i.e., task definitions, planning and goal setting, enactment, and evaluation), and learning outcomes during complex mathematics problem solving. Path analyses revealed that both surprise and boredom negatively predicted planning and goal setting. To explain the consequences of surprise, Muis, Psaradellis, et al. noted that the negative relations between surprise and planning and goal setting were more likely a function of confusion following surprise, rather than surprise itself. Although D'Mello et al. (2014) demonstrated that confusion can be beneficial for learning, Muis, Psaradellis, et al. found that confusion was negatively related to elementary students' learning when given a complex task. As Muis, Psaradellis, et al. noted, subsequent research should model surprise as an antecedent to confusion and curiosity to account for the temporal ordering of these emotions and to fully account for relations between epistemic emotions and planning and goal setting.

Motivation. As Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, and Jarvis (1996) proposed, emotions may relate to individuals' disposition toward knowledge, such as need for cognition. Need for cognition is defined as a motivational drive to engage in effortful thinking. Need for cognition can be contrasted with need for closure, which reflects a state or trait drive to reduce experiences of discomfort that are generated by uncertainty and the desire for definitive knowledge (Kruglanski &

Webster, 1996). With regard to state, rather than trait motivation, when individuals experience positive activating emotions, such as curiosity or joy, this may enhance their need for cognition. In addition, under conditions of learning wherein contradictory information is presented, or information is complex and challenging, surprise and confusion may subsequently drive need for cognition given the joy they will experience by engaging in cognitively demanding tasks.

In contrast, some individuals may experience anxiety when presented with contradictory information. Under this condition, need for closure may be heightened. Alternatively, if confusion arises due to some cognitive incongruity, or frustration if they judge the information to be difficult to learn, laborious, or aversive, then individuals high on need for closure will be driven to "seize" on early information and immediately "freeze," subsequently ignoring any further information (Kruglanski, 2013). If individuals do not freeze, they may quicken their reading pace and enhance the volume of informational search to come to some closure. They may also be resistant to persuasive arguments aimed at undermining their closure, or may simply ignore information that does not help them achieve closure (Kruglanski, 2013).

For example, Lombardi and Sinatra (2013) examined relations between teachers' emotions about climate change, their motivation (both need for cognition and need for closure), prior knowledge, and plausibility judgments about climate change. Plausibility judgments are evaluations of the potential truthfulness of incoming information relative to one's current existing mental representations (Rescher, 1976). In addition to the self- report instruments used to measure the various constructs, Lombardi and Sinatra conducted field observations along with detailed interviews with two of the teachers. Of particular interest, Lombardi and Sinatra reported that negative emotions like anger or frustration may reduce the evaluative judgment needed to weigh evidence and decide whether climate change is actually occurring.

Of course, trait dispositions for need for cognition or need for closure may be another antecedent to the kinds of epistemic emotions learners experience during learning (Lombardi & Sinatra, 2013). For example, individuals high on need for cognition may experience joy when the task is particularly challenging, whereas individuals high on need for closure may experience anxiety under the same conditions. This reflects the reciprocal and dynamic nature of relations between antecedents and consequences that we elaborate later (see also Linnenbrink & Pintrich's [2002] bidirectional model of motivation and affect).

Cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Following Pekrun's (2006) control- value theory of achievement emotions, we propose that epistemic emotions predict the cognitive and metacognitive strategies that individuals employ during learning. Specifically, under conditions of cognitive incongruity, surprise, curiosity, and confusion should lead

to higher rates of metacognitive strategies and more effortful cognitive strategies to resolve the incongruity, especially when perceptions of control are high. Under other conditions, anxiety and frustration may lead to a reduction in effortful strategies but an increase in more shallow- processing strategies due to the cognitive resources being consumed by the negative activating emotions (see Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfeld, & Perry, 2011; Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). Finally, boredom will lead to a reduction in all cognitive and metacognitive strategies (Pekrun et al., 2011). The learning strategies that individuals use subsequently predict learning outcomes (Muis, 2007), and relations between learning strategies and learning outcomes will depend on task complexity. That is, easier tasks like memorizing formulas or definitions for a test that assess recall of information do not require more complex processing strategies such as elaboration or critical thinking. Rather, one expects that simple rehearsal maintenance would be sufficient under this evaluative context.

Researchers have also suggested that surprising information results in an increase in attention to the surprising information (Foster & Keane, 2015), thereby assigning cognitive resources to resolve the discrepancy (i.e., to explain it). Learners may also perceive that they need to engage in more cognitive and metacognitive processing to resolve the cognitive disequilibrium caused by the surprising event (Foster & Keane, 2015). That is, learners may engage in more intense processing of the information, such as self- explanation to explain the surprising event, which has been shown to improve comprehension and learning (Durkin, 2011; Roy & Chi, 2005).

Indeed, several studies we reviewed explored relations between epistemic emotions, self- reported or actual learning strategies, and learning outcomes (e.g., Chevrier et al., 2015; Jaber & Hammer, 2015, 2016; Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015; Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015; Muis & Singh, 2018; Richter & Schmid, 2010). In Muis, Pekrun, et al.'s (2015) study, path analyses revealed that counter to hypothesized relations, surprise negatively predicted critical thinking. However, in support of their hypotheses, confusion, curiosity, and joy positively predicted metacognitive self- regulation. Moreover, curiosity positively predicted critical thinking, as did anxiety, and joy positively predicted elaboration and rehearsal, whereas boredom negatively predicted rehearsal. Also counter to their predictions, metacognitive self- regulation negatively predicted learning outcomes but, in support of their predictions, critical thinking and elaboration positively predicted learning outcomes. Finally, with regard to mediation analyses, epistemic emotions mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, and learning strategies mediated relations between epistemic emotions and learning outcomes.

To explain the unexpected negative relation between surprise and critical thinking, Muis, Pekrun, et al. (2015) proposed that state transition analyses would likely reveal that surprise was followed by an increase or decrease in critical thinking during complex learning depending on whether curiosity or confusion followed surprise. That is, given the moderate positive correlations they found between surprise, curiosity, and confusion, and the negative correlation between confusion and critical thinking, they proposed that surprise is likely an antecedent to curiosity and confusion rather than critical thinking. They suggested that surprise is the first emotion to occur and, depending on whether curiosity or confusion follows surprise, critical thinking would increase or decrease.

To empirically evaluate these possibilities, Chevrier et al. (2015) conducted a replication and extension of Muis, Pekrun, et al.'s (2015) study using a think aloud protocol to capture epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self- regulatory strategies. They examined the frequency of two- state transitions from epistemic emotions at time  $t$  to a follow- up state at time  $t + 1$ . Follow- up states included epistemic cognitive processes, other affective states (including emotions of various object foci), and learning strategies. As Muis, Pekrun, et al. originally suspected, state- transition analyses in Chevrier et al.'s study revealed that curiosity increased the likelihood of metacognitive self- regulation, whereas surprise decreased the likelihood of reproduction strategies and increased the likelihood of critical thinking. In contrast, results from path analyses using self- report data replicated the same pattern of results that Muis, Pekrun, et al. found. As such, path analyses may have reflected a spurious relationship. Alternatively, perhaps surprise was an antecedent to curiosity and confusion; that is, curiosity and confusion may differentially mediate relations between surprise and critical thinking.

Learning outcomes. Philosophers have argued that epistemic emotions, such as surprise, curiosity, and confusion, draw salience and attention to the object that caused that emotion, which can lead to an increase in learning outcomes (Elgin, 2008; Morton, 2010). These same emotions, however, can also draw attention away from the task at hand (Meinhardt & Pekrun, 2003), resulting in a decrease in learning outcomes (Ellis et al., 1995). Several theorists have argued that the negative effects of negative emotions on learning outcomes can be attributed to the limited cognitive resources that individuals can allocate during learning (Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988). As Ellis and Ashbrook (1988) explained in their resource allocation model, based on the concept of limited processing capacity, negative emotions may increase the information- processing load, thereby reducing attentional resources that could otherwise be allocated to the task at hand. However, as Pekrun (1992)

argued, this decrease in attentional allocation need not be limited to negative emotions; positive emotions may also draw attention away when the object focus of those emotions is not the task itself (Meinhardt & Pekrun, 2003).

Since the 1950s, studies in cognitive and developmental psychology have explored the antecedents of surprise and curiosity and their consequences with regard to learning outcomes (Berlyne, 1954; Litman & Jimerson, 2004; Loewenstein, 1994; see Jirout & Klahr, 2012, for a complete review). In Berlyne's (1954) seminal work, participants were presented trivia items intended to elicit cognitive conflict. Participants were presented a series of items, rated their level of surprise for each item, and then rated how much curiosity each item evoked. Results revealed a positive correlation between surprise and curiosity. Of interest, individuals were more likely to learn the answers to items that received the highest ratings of surprise and curiosity, which he argued was due to an increased focus on that information.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, Kang et al. (2009) revealed that curiosity evoked during learning increased activity in memory areas after participants gave incorrect answers to questions. Moreover, on high- curiosity trials, participants' pupil dilation responses (i.e., widening of the pupils) ramped up 1 to 2 s before the onset of the answer display, which was significantly more than trials rated as moderate or low on curiosity. In addition, curiosity predicted subsequent recall of responses to items that were initially guessed incorrectly. Based on these results, Kang et al. proposed that curiosity following surprise increases attention to incoming information and increases activation of the areas of the brain responsible for memory and learning, which results in better learning outcomes.

Revisions to control, value, and epistemic beliefs. Drawing from Muis's (2007) model, the final consequence we propose is that epistemic emotions may play a role in changes to learners' perceptions of control and value for learning, and in changes to their epistemic beliefs. For example, an individual may set an initial epistemic aim for understanding the health risks and benefits of vaccinations and may initially perceive a high sense of control for understanding the content. However, an initial exploration for information on vaccinations on the Internet may leave the individual feeling overwhelmed and confused by all of the contradictory information, resulting in a decreased perception of capacity to understand. This, in turn, may lead the individual to adjust her perception of control. Alternatively, an individual may enter the same learning situation with some initial beliefs about the health benefits and risks of vaccinations and have a moderate perceived level of control. That individual may also be aware of the numerous inaccurate websites on vaccinations and may know which sites are valid. Once that individual begins to develop an understanding of the health risks and benefits, she may experience joy in moving toward her epistemic aim, thereby increasing her sense of control.

As another example, a learner may be given the task to understand the causes and consequences of the Seven Years War between France and Great Britain. Initially, the learner may not particularly value learning about this war. The learner may discover, however, that when the French lost, they conceded all territory in North America to the British. This concession resulted in French Canadians' loss of their rights to their own language, culture, and religion. Surprised by this, the student may then understand why Quebec has laws to protect these rights and their culture. As a resident of Quebec, this new information and new understanding of Quebec culture may increase value for learning about the Seven Years War.

Of course, the ideas we present here are mere speculation; we are not aware of any studies that have explored changes in control or value as a function of emotions (although the rich literature on mood- congruent retrieval makes this plausible). However, research has been conducted with regard to the role of emotions in epistemic belief change (Bendixen, 2002). Bendixen (2002) conducted a phenomenological account of how individuals experience epistemic doubt and the processes involved in resolution of that doubt. Through interviews, Bendixen inferred that all participants experienced epistemic doubt when they were exposed to information that was inconsistent with their epistemic beliefs. This cognitive incongruity resulted in feelings of confusion, uncertainty, and instability, which led to epistemic doubt. For most participants, negative emotions were followed by a reflection on their beliefs, which participants subsequently changed. In contrast, some participants chose to ignore the discrepant information and reaffirmed or strengthened their original beliefs.

Taken together, there is wealth of empirical work that has shown that epistemic emotions predict the kinds of plans and goals individuals set for learning, their levels of epistemic motivation, the cognitive and metacognitive strategies that learners employ during learning, and learning outcomes. As such, epistemic emotions can facilitate or constrain learning processes and learning outcomes. However, much more empirical work is needed to fully chart the complex relations proposed throughout this article. Next we discuss future directions and end with educational implications.

# GENERAL DISCUSSION

# Directions for Future Research

Future research must progress beyond the singular study of relations between one facet of personal epistemology and SRL. That is, the vast majority of research on personal epistemology has focused primarily on relations between epistemic beliefs and SRL. Given the lack of substantial relations between epistemic beliefs and SRL (Schraw, 2013), it is time to broaden our epistemic horizons. We

urge researchers to consider the more fine- grained components of personal epistemology (e.g., epistemic strategies, epistemic value, epistemic aims, epistemic emotions) and their dynamic and reciprocal relations to SRL. Coupled with more variability in methods, we argue that these constructs will reveal far more meaningful relations with SRL. SRL is a dynamic process that unfolds over time, and it is critical to measure it as such: Exploring relations between personal epistemology and SRL should also be modeled as dynamic and unfolding over time.

With regard to future directions based on our first proposition, we advanced that epistemic beliefs, control, and task value predict the type of epistemic emotions that are likely to ensue during subsequent phases of SRL. One avenue for future research will be to empirically examine how each element contributes to the prediction of epistemic emotions relative to others and how predictors might interact to moderate hypothesized relations. Are epistemic beliefs more predictive than control and value, or vice versa? Under what conditions will relations vary in terms of importance? To date, research that has examined epistemic beliefs as antecedents to epistemic emotions has explored complex learning contexts. Do epistemic beliefs predict epistemic emotions during simple learning tasks?

Manipulation of and interventions on predictors of epistemic emotions have the potential to contribute to a greater understanding of the arousal of epistemic emotions in various learning situations. Bromme, Pieschl, and Stahl (2010) have used epistemic sensitization via an introductory paragraph to stimulate epistemic beliefs in undergraduate students. They found that the paragraph was successful in activating more constructivist epistemic beliefs during the experiment. Similarly, various learning environments are likely to support perceptions of control and value, as well as the setting of epistemic aims. Muls, Trevors, and Chevrier (2016) described five facets of a learning environment (i.e., pedagogy, authority, curriculum, evaluation, and support) that constitute an epistemic climate conducive to epistemic change toward more constructivist views. For instance, learning environments that are supportive of students being wrong, or adopting beliefs that differ from the norm, might be more conducive to the attainment of epistemic aims than more conservative and consensual environments, which may withhold individuals from adopting new beliefs about a topic. Such learning environments may promote the setting of sophisticated epistemic aims (e.g., the aim to acquire true beliefs) alongside nonepistemic aims (e.g., the aim to finish a task; Chin & Rinehart, 2016). Within this context, learners may then experience more positive epistemic emotions. Conducting research in epistemic environments that support various epistemic aims is one way to advance knowledge about the arousal of epistemic emotions in learning contexts.

We have suggested a number of predictors and consequences of epistemic emotions, but our list might not be exhaustive. Components of task conditions that arise in a group context may have a significant impact on the arousal of epistemic emotions that have yet to be empirically explored. Group norms for justification (Faulkner, 2010), (dis)agreement among group members (Sosa, 2010), coregulatory processes, negotiated group aims, and social epistemic emotions (e.g., curiosity about what someone else thinks) may reveal interesting relations to SRL. Knowledge revision (or lack thereof) may be another consequence with regard to revisions to antecedents (Trevors et al., 2016). Refutation texts that explicitly state common misconceptions and then refute them may trigger surprise, followed by curiosity or confusion when those misconceptions are held. Depending on whether curiosity or confusion follows surprise, this can have variable consequences for knowledge revision. Future research is also needed to explore how such factors might predict epistemic emotions across various contexts. Moreover, future research should assess whether other academic emotions (e.g., achievement, topic, social emotions) that arise during task definition interact with the arousal of epistemic emotions during learning. For example, if individuals are angry about a particular topic, like vaccinations, does their topic emotion predict greater levels of epistemic confusion or frustration during learning about that topic? Or does their anger deplete attentional resources to the point where they are less likely to recognize contradictory information, resulting in less confusion during learning?

Research is also needed to explore the appraisal space that we propose in Figure 2. Although Silvia (2010) established the shared space between confusion and curiosity, we have expanded this to include all seven epistemic emotions we reviewed in addition to perceptions of value, capacity, novelty, and complexity. Questions of particular interest are as follows: How might the various components interact? What are the temporal dynamics of the various states? What interventions can be developed to manipulate the conditions under which epistemic emotions arise?

It is clear that fully testing and expanding a model as complex as the one proposed here will require methodological innovations. We believe that it is critical that studies be conducted with learners of all ages, especially children, who are becoming consumers of the Internet at an increasingly young age. Although research has been carried out with younger populations to examine epistemic understanding (Ryu & Sandoval, 2012), judgments of the epistemic status of sources of justification (Sandoval & Cam, 2011), and use of evidence (Sandoval, 2005), much research is still needed to understand how personal epistemology develops alongside SRL and emotion regulation in the context of complex and epistemically sensitive contexts. Likewise, older and nonstudent populations that have not been trained in digital literacy are facing the challenge of learning about complex and controversial topics. As just demonstrated, epistemic emotions are likely to arise and, if individuals are

not equipped to handle the array of emotions they may experience, learning may be constrained. More research is needed to understand how personal epistemology hinders or facilitates learning in those often- neglected populations.

Last, we emphasize the importance of interventions aimed at increasing emotion regulation to facilitate more effective SRL. It is becoming increasingly evident that successful SRL lies in part in successful emotion regulation given the relations we found across the various studies (Gross, 2014). On the basis of the model we presented here, educational interventions should embed instruction on epistemic strategies for dealing with or responding to epistemic emotions, but also aim to develop individuals' self- efficacy in carrying out those strategies, even when this involves questioning authorities or expert sources (Trevors et al., 2016). It is important that researchers tackle the important issue of negative epistemic emotions such as confusion, which, if left unregulated, can quickly lead to frustration, boredom, and disengagement (D'Mello & Graesser, 2012). However, the development of such interventions cannot proceed without the creation of learning material designed to arouse optimal and beneficial levels of surprise, curiosity, and confusion (D'Mello et al., 2014). Such educational implications are discussed next.

# Educational Implications

At the beginning of this article, we discussed how learners' ability to make informed decisions along with their capacity to select and distinguish high- quality from low- quality information are key learning skills in the world of Web 2.0. Important to note, given the high likelihood that a variety of epistemic emotions will arise during learning of complex, contradictory information, it is necessary that epistemic emotions are also taken into consideration in today's learning environments. Accordingly, we present pedagogical suggestions that may help teachers construct learning environments within an epistemic climate that promotes positive epistemic emotions, critical and reflective thinking, and the skills needed to resolve negative epistemic emotions when they arise. It is our contention that educational design considerations should target both the antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions to facilitate SRL. We delineate some possibilities here.

First, to promote the revision of epistemic beliefs, teachers could place emphasis on the importance of student engagement and experience in the social construction of knowledge such as negotiation, contemplation, reflection, dialogue, debate, and consensus making. A study by Angeli and Valanides (2012) explored the connections between quality of thinking and epistemic beliefs during complex problem- solving tasks. Compared to working alone, they found that when working in groups of two, students' emotions and culture played a greater role than learned content, cognitive strategies, or epistemic beliefs in how individuals reasoned about a controversial topic. Therefore, we suggest that learners should be afforded ample opportunity to discuss and reflect on their ideas, assumptions, emotions, and suppositions with regard to presented information and be encouraged to listen to, contemplate, and deliberate on the logic and validity of others' viewpoints. By fostering more constructivist epistemic beliefs, learners may then experience more positive epistemic emotions when dealing with complex content.

In addition, to increase students' need for cognition and decrease need for closure, students should be instructed on how to deal with conflicting perspectives and be taught emotion regulation (i.e., reappraisal of their emotions; see Gross, 2014) in addition to strategies to effectively respond to the issues that these emotions signal. Indeed, as previously discussed, anxiety or frustration may arise for individuals who experience epistemic incongruity in the face of multiple perspectives and for those who find it difficult to attain their epistemic aims (e.g., the aim to find truth) in such situations. If left unresolved, these negative emotions may foster a need for closure, whereby learners seek to terminate the cognitive and affective discomfort as quickly as possible, to the detriment of effortful thinking. As such, one way to help students increase their motivation, regulate their emotions, and use productive learning strategies is by providing students with training on how to differentiate and evaluate the validity and reliability of various sources of information, how to consider alternative paths to problem solving, and how to use deep learning strategies such as knowledge elaboration or critical thinking. Such training has been shown to increase constructivist- oriented epistemic beliefs (Muis & Duffy, 2013).

Given the positive benefits of curiosity, we also suggest that teachers develop learning environments that foster curiosity by providing learning opportunities that are complex but comprehensible (Wouters et al., 2015). Following Ames (1992), students should be offered choice in tasks, as students will choose something that they are more curious about. This should drive effort and persistence, leading to better learning processes and learning outcomes (Jirout & Klahr, 2012; Muis, Pekrun, et al., 2015). Under these conditions, positive emotions may arise and in turn promote learners' need for cognition and open- mindedness in the face of new perspectives.

Finally, classroom interventions are needed that focus on the regulation and normalization of confusion. Confusion is an unavoidable consequence of learning but need not result in negative consequences for learning. We suggest that educators communicate and demonstrate to students how to effectively regulate and resolve confusion as it arises (VanLehn, Siler, Murray, Yamauchi, & Baggett, 2003). As previously mentioned, D'Mello et al. (2014) posited that confusion may be a favorable affective circumstance when it comes to knowledge acquisition only after learners develop the required regulatory strategies to resolve confusion. In this way, it is not the occurrence of confusion itself that may benefit learning but the effective resolution of confusion (Lehman et al., 2013). In line with Muis, Psaradellis,

et al. (2015), we suggest that teacher support is required; however, the type of teacher intervention will depend on the age of the student and the degree or persistence of confusion. Previous research indicates that younger students may not be equipped to independently resolve episodes of confusion (Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015), and as such, we offer two methods to regulate confusion. With younger students and/or students experiencing persistent confusion, from the cognitive behavior therapy literature (Beck, 2011), we recommend that teachers first relay the message that confusion is a normal and inherent part of learning (i.e., normalizing confusion), provide scaffolding by way of explicit hints and explanations, and have learners articulate their confusion so as to encourage reflection on the cognitive impasse. For older students, following suggestions made by VanLehn et al. (2003), we suggest that students identify the impasse, find a potential solution to resolve it, and provide an explanation for the solution they formulate.

In closing, by considering the antecedents of epistemic emotions and their resulting consequences in relation to SRL, we encourage teachers to sensitize themselves to the impact that epistemic emotions have on students' learning, and ultimately on students' ability to acquire knowledge. By providing the kinds of learning environments described in this article, coupled with specific strategy and emotion regulation training, teachers can help students develop the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of today's knowledge and become the critical thinkers of tomorrow.
