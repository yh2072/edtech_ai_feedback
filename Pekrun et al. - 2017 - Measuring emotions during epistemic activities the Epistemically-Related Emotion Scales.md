# ABSTRACT

ABSTRACTMeasurement instruments assessing multiple emotions during epistemic activities are largely lacking. We describe the construction and validation of the Epistemically- Related Emotion Scales, which measure surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom occurring during epistemic cognitive activities. The instrument was tested in a multinational study of emotions during learning from conflicting texts ( $N = 438$  university students from the United States, Canada, and Germany). The findings document the reliability, internal validity, and external validity of the instrument. A seven- factor model best fit the data, suggesting that epistemically- related emotions should be conceptualised in terms of discrete emotion categories, and the scales showed metric invariance across the North American and German samples. Furthermore, emotion scores changed over time as a function of conflicting task information and related significantly to perceived task value and use of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies.

# KEYWORDS

KEYWORDSEpistemic emotion; surprise; curiosity; confusion; value appraisal

Research has started to acknowledge the importance of emotions for complex learning and cognitive performance (see e.g. Pekrun & Linnenbrink- Garcia, 2014). In this nascent field of inquiry, researchers have focused on examining achievement emotions, such as hope, pride, anxiety, or shame related to success and failure. However, emotions that are triggered by the cognitive characteristics of tasks can also be of fundamental importance for learning, such as surprise, curiosity, or confusion about contradictory information. As proposed by epistemologists, these affective states represent epistemic emotions because they relate to the knowledge- generating qualities of cognitive activities (Brun, DoguoÄŸlu, & Kuenzle, 2008; Morton, 2010). Empirical findings support the view that epistemic emotions can strongly impact learning and performance (e.g. D'Mello, Lehman, Pekrun, & Graesser, 2014; Kang et al., 2009).

Further progress in research on epistemic emotions requires measurement instruments to assess these emotions. Specifically, instruments are needed that measure multiple emotions during epistemic activity and that are suited to track the dynamics of these emotions over time. To date, measurement of these emotions has focused on assessing curiosity (Jirout & Kahr, 2012). In addition, researchers have used qualitative self- report and single- item instruments assessing various emotions, such as emotion checklists (e.g. D'Mello & Graesser, 2012). By contrast, systematic multi- item instruments suited to assess a broader range of these emotions are lacking. We aimed to redress this deficit by developing multi- item self- report scales measuring seven major emotions that occur during epistemic activity and are believed to be of primary importance for learning and the generation of knowledge (Epistemically- Related Emotion Scales (EES)).

We first outline the concept of epistemic emotions that guided this research. Next, we describe the development of the EES. We then report results from a multinational investigation that used conflicting texts about climate change to arouse epistemic emotions. Data from this study were employed to examine the reliability, internal validity, and external validity of the instrument.

# Defining epistemic emotions

Epistemic emotions relate to the knowledge- generating qualities of cognitive tasks and activities (Brun et al., 2008). For these emotions, knowledge and the generation of knowledge are the objects of emotions. This definition of epistemic emotions by object focus is equivalent to the definition of other types of epistemic variables that share the same focus, such as epistemic cognition, epistemic metacognition, and epistemic beliefs. Epistemic emotions differ from these other epistemic variables by their affective nature.

Epistemic emotions represent a major category of human emotion serving evolutionary- based purposes of acquiring knowledge about the world and the self. A prototypical situation for the arousal of epistemic emotions is discrepant information and appraisals of cognitive incongruity that can trigger surprise and curiosity (Kang et al., 2009), confusion, frustration, and boredom when the incongruity cannot be resolved (D'Mello & Graesser, 2012; D'Mello et al., 2014), anxiety in the case of severe incongruity and information that deeply disturbs existing beliefs (Hookway, 2008), or enjoyment and delight when the problem is solved. Appraisals of the positive value of an epistemic activity should promote positive epistemic emotions (cuisosity, enjoyment) and reduce boredom. Epistemic emotions are closely related to the concepts of cognitive emotions (Scheffler, 1991) and knowledge emotions (Silvia, 2010). We prefer to use the term epistemic emotion because it is well established in epistemology (Brun et al., 2008) and aligned with terms denoting other constructs related to epistemic processes, such as epistemic beliefs.

To conceptualise epistemic emotions, it is critical to attend to the defining features of emotion. We propose to adopt a multicomponent approach (e.g. Scherer, 2009), which implies that emotions are systems of coordinated psychological processes including affective, cognitive, physiological, motivational, and behavioural components. An affective state qualifies as an epistemic emotion if it comprises these elements. Accordingly, surprise, enjoyment, anxiety, frustration, and boredom related to knowledge and knowing can be considered epistemic emotions. This is also true for curiosity and confusion which traditionally have not been classified as emotions, but have been shown to involve affective feelings, physiological arousal, motivational impulses, as well as specific patterns of facial expression (e.g. Markey & Loewenstein, 2014; Reeve, 1993; Rozin & Cohen, 2003).

Epistemic emotions differ from other groups of human emotions, such as social, moral, or achievement emotions, in terms of their object focus (Brun et al., 2008). As noted, knowledge and the generation of knowledge are the objects for epistemic emotions; in social, moral, and achievement emotions, other persons, moral norms, or success and failure, respectively, are the objects. Some emotions are epistemic by nature, such as curiosity and confusion, whereas others can belong to various categories of emotion, depending on the object focus of attention. For example, during cognitive activities, some emotions can be experienced as epistemic emotions or as achievement emotions (Pekrun & Perry, 2014). A student's frustration at not deriving a correct solution to a mathematics problem would be considered an epistemic emotion if the focus is on the cognitive incongruity resulting from the unsolved problem. However, if the focus is on personal failure and the inability to solve the problem, then the student's frustration would be considered an achievement emotion. As such, it is important to acknowledge that epistemic emotions can share affective properties with other categories of emotion but differ from them in terms of their object focus (Brun et al., 2008).

# Development of the EES

We aimed to develop a self- report instrument capturing major emotions that occur frequently in epistemic contexts and are functionally relevant for learning and cognitive problem solving. Curiosity, joy, confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom have been found to be especially frequent and powerful in these contexts (see e.g. D'Mello, 2013; Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). We added surprise which represents an immediate affective reaction to cognitive incongruity and serves to promote subsequent epistemic cognition. As such, we developed scales measuring surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, frustration,

and boredom. The scales represent all of the emotions targeted in D'Mello and Graesser's (2012; D'Mello et al., 2014) model of impasse- driven emotions and Pekrun and Stephens's (2012) classification of epistemic emotions.

Our goal was to create an instrument that tracks changes in these emotions across episodes of cognitive activity and renders psychometrically sound scores. Accordingly, it was necessary to create multiple scales consisting of several items each. However, to allow for an examination of these emotions as temporally fluctuating states, the instrument needs to be simple and quick to administer.

To serve these purposes, the EES uses emotion adjectives as items, which allows for quick responses and limits the influence of the items on respondents' emotions. To keep scale length at a minimum, three items were included per scale. As such, the instrument contains 7 three- item scales (21 items overall; Appendix). Selection of items was based on existing emotion scales and information about frequently used emotion words (see Supplemental Material). Items are answered using a 5- point Likert scale that asks respondents to report how strongly they feel the emotion  $1 =$  not at all to  $5 =$  very strong). The instrument includes contextualised instructions (Appendix), which can be adapted to address different settings.

Additionally, a short version of the EES is available that uses one item per emotion only (Appendix). Items were selected for their semantic properties to best represent the respective emotion, and all had factor loadings  $>.69$  (Supplemental Material; Table S1). This version may be especially useful when it is necessary to keep administration time short. Similar to experience sampling methodology, it is minimally invasive and can be employed to measure respondents' emotions while carrying out a task.

# Aims of the present research

The present study examined item and scale statistics, reliability, internal test validity, and external test validity for the EES. Data from a multinational investigation were used (Muis et al., 2015). The study examined epistemic emotions in the context of a learning task in which students had to read and interpret conflicting texts. In the conceptual change literature, use of conflicting information presented in texts is a standard procedure to trigger cognitive conflict (Muis & Duffy, 2013), which is expected to induce epistemic emotions. Correlational analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were employed to test internal validity in terms of the distinctiveness of the seven emotions and the measurement equivalence of the EES across the participant samples from different countries.

To evaluate external validity, we analysed the impact of the conflicting texts, which were supposed to increase surprise, curiosity, and confusion. In addition, we investigated relations between the measured emotions, the perceived value of the learning task, and participants' self- reported use of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies. We expected perceived value of the task to relate positively to the intensity of the emotions except boredom, and we expected activating emotions (i.e. surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, and frustration) to correlate positively and boredom to correlate negatively with strategy use (see Muis et al., 2015; Pekrun & Stephens, 2012).

# Method

# Participants

The sample included  $N = 438$  university students from the United States  $(n = 138, 116$  females), Canada  $(n = 152, 114$  females), and Germany  $(n = 148, 129$  females). Sample size was defined by the availability of participants. At each of the three sites, we recruited as many participants as possible until the end of the predefined time period for the study, and the data of all participants were included in the analysis. Mean age was  $M = 21.76$  years  $(SD = 4.28$  years), with  $M = 20.09, 21.81$ , and  $23.27$ $(SD = 1.72, 3.87$ , and  $5.67)$  for the United States, Canadian, and German samples, respectively.

# Procedure

The EES was administered as part of Muis et al.'s (2015) study on epistemic beliefs and epistemic processes when reading conflicting texts about climate change. Being a controversial topic, this issue is particularly well suited to induce epistemic emotions. The findings of a think- aloud study using the same texts confirmed that this procedure elicited cognitive conflict, and that the vast majority of the emotions that occurred during reading the texts were epistemic (Muis et al., 2015).

Participants first responded to a task value questionnaire. Next, they were confronted with four texts,

which were adopted from BrÃ¥ten and StrÃ¸msÃ¸ (2009). The first pair of texts presented conflicting information on the causes of climate change (man- made vs. natural), whereas the second pair presented conflicting information on the consequences of climate change (positive vs. negative). Prior to reading the texts, participants were alerted to the conflicting information contained in the texts (see Supplemental Material). After each of the first three texts, participants completed the short 7- item version of the EES to report the emotions they had experienced while reading the texts. After the last text, participants completed the full 21- item version of the EES to report the emotions they had experienced while reading all four texts. Following this, they self- reported the frequency with which they used cognitive and metacognitive strategies to learn the material across the four texts.

# Measures

# Emotions

The long and short versions of the EES were used to assess students' epistemically- related emotions (see Appendix).

# Perceived task value and learning strategies

Perceived value of the task was assessed with seven items adapted from Wigfield (1994; e.g. "In general, I find learning about climate change very interesting"). Four scales from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993) assessed participants' use of strategies during learning, including rehearsal, critical thinking, elaboration, and metacognitive self- regulation (4, 5, 6, and 12 items, respectively). For both measures, participants responded on a 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (very true of me) scale, and the scores were summed to form the task value and strategy indexes (as = .86, .59, .83, .72, and .69, respectively).

# Scale versions for German participants

The original English- language versions of the EES, the Task Value Scale, and the MSLQ scales were translated into the German language by two German emotion experts and one bilingual translator.

# Rationale for CFA

CFA using Mplus 7.3 (MuthÃ©n & MuthÃ©n, 2012) was employed to test the internal validity of the 21- item

EES. To estimate parameters, the robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) was used which is robust to non- normality of the observed variables. Emotions were modelled as latent variables, and the scale items served as manifest indicators. First, CFA was used to examine the structural validity of the EES, including competitive testing of different models representing the seven emotions (Figure 1). Second, multi- group CFA was employed to investigate measurement invariance in a series of sequentially more restrictive models fixing parameters to be equal across participant groups from different countries. The fit of each model was compared to the fit of the previous model. Specifically, we tested (a) a configural invariance model; (b) a metric invariance model that restricted factor loadings to be equal across groups; and (c) a scalar invariance model that additionally restricted intercepts to be equal (Byrne, 2008).

# Results and discussion

# Item and scale statistics

Item and scale statistics document that there was sufficient variance in scores on all items and scales, despite positive skewness for some of the scales (see Supplemental Material, Tables S1 and S2). Furthermore, item- total correlations (part- whole corrected) were above .53 for all items, and reliabilities were in the  $a = .76$  to .88 range (Table 1). These findings indicate that the EES scales show sufficient variation and that scale reliabilities range from good to excellent.

# Internal validity

# Correlational analysis

Correlations between scores for the long EES scales and scores for the short EES scales (averaged across assessments) ranged from  $r = .65$  to .83 for the same emotions, suggesting convergent validity (Supplemental Material, Table S5). Correlations between scales for different emotions indicate that the emotions measured by the EES are distinct from each other, with most of the correlations ranging from  $r = .10$  to .40 (see Table 1 for the long scales and Supplemental Material, Table S3, for the short scales). However, the pattern of correlations diverges from the relations found for other types of emotions. Typically, positive emotions correlate positively, negative emotions correlate positively, and correlations between positive and negative emotions tend to be

Figure 1. Structure of CFA models for epistemic emotions. Notes: Upper part: Model 1 (one-factor model); middle part: Model 2 (two-factor model); lower part: Model 3 (seven-factor model). Item labels are  $\sin =$  surprise;  $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{U} =$  curiosity;  $\mathrm{jo} =$  enjoyment;  $\cos =$  confusion;  $\alpha \mathbf{X} =$  anxiety; fr  $=$  frustration; and  $\mathtt{bo} =$  boredom.

negative (e.g. achievement emotions; Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). Herein, all emotions except boredom showed positive correlations, including surprise, positively valenced emotions (curiosity, enjoyment), as well as negatively valenced emotions (confusion, anxiety, frustration). As such, these correlations suggest that emotions during epistemic activities are primarily linked along the arousal dimension of emotion rather than the valence dimension. In contrast to deactivating boredom, epistemic surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, and frustration can be considered activating emotions, and these emotions correlated positively, regardless of their valence.

# Confirmatory factor analysis

Preliminary support for the internal validity of the EES was provided by exploratory factor analysis (see Supplemental Material). To further examine the homogeneity and distinctiveness of the scales (long versions), we used CFA and compared three models that varied in their degree of differentiation between emotions (Figure 1). Model 1 was a one- factor model that contained one bipolar factor representing all emotions. Model 2 was a two- factor model that differentiated between positive and negative epistemic affect. The items for curiosity and enjoyment were used as indicators for positive affect, and the items for confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom were used as indicators for negative affect. In two variants of this model, the items for surprise were used as indicators of either positive affect (Model 2a) or negative affect (Model 2b). Finally, Model 3 was a seven- factor model that differentiated between all seven emotions.

The one- factor model did not fit the data;  $X^{2}(210) = 2724.12$ ,  $p < .01$ , comparative fit index (CFI)  $= .383$ , Tucker- Lewis index (TLI)  $= .322$ , root

aLatent corrlations in lower-left diagonal matrix; manifest correlations in upper right diagonal matrix; alpha coefficients in the diagonal. bPartial corrlations controling for curiosity and boredom. These correlations were calculated to meet a concen that the bivariate corrlations of surprise, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, and frustration with task value and learning strategies are driven by curiosity and boredom. The correlations show that most of these relations are preserved when controlling for curiosity and boredom although reduced in size, which suggests that these emotions have relations with value and strategies that are independent from the influence of curiosity and boredom.  $^k p < .05,$ $^{**}p < .01$ $^{**}p < .001$

mean square error of approximation  $(\mathsf{RMSEA}) = .165,$  and standardized root mean square residual  $(\mathsf{SRMR}) = .176$  Fit for the two variants of the two- factor model was better but also not acceptable. Interestingly, Model 2a (surprise as part of positive affect) showed a slightly better fit than Model 2b (surprise as part of negative affect), with  $X^{2}(188) =$  2086.80,  $p < .01$ $CFI = .515$ $\mathsf{TLI} = .458$ $\mathsf{RMSEA} = .152,$ $\mathsf{SRMR} = .164,$  and  $X^{2}(188) = 2252.39,$ $\mathsf{CFI} = .473,$  TLI  $= .411$ $\mathsf{RMSEA} = .158,$  and  $\mathsf{TLI} = .171$  respectively. This is in line with the correlations for surprise which indicated that surprise is primarily related to curiosity and enjoyment (Table 1), and suggests that surprise is positively valenced in an epistemic context.

In contrast to the one- factor and two- factor models, the seven- factor model showed a good fit;  $X^{2}(168) = 418.38,$ $\mathsf{CFI} = .936,$ $\mathsf{TLI} = .920$ $\mathsf{RMSEA} = .058,$  and  $\mathsf{SRMR} = .056$  The factor loadings for the model were above .60 for all items, and above .70 for 18 of the 21 items (Supplemental Material, Table S1). This finding confirms that the EES emotion factors can be considered sufficiently homogenous.

Furthermore, the analysis provides estimates for the latent correlations between the emotions (Table 1). The pattern of correlations is the same as the manifest correlations, with positive correlations between the activating emotions and a more differentiated pattern of relations for boredom. Importantly, although some of these correlations were relatively high, they clearly indicate that all of the emotion constructs are separable, given that latent correlations are corrected for unreliability and represent the highest possible estimates of these relations. As such, the results of CFA show that the seven emotions included in the EES are distinct. These emotions would not be adequately represented by summary factors of positive and negative affect; rather, they need to be assessed in differentiated ways.

# Measurement equivalence across countries

Multi- group CFA with the long version of the EES was used to examine measurement equivalence of the instrument across countries. The type of measurement invariance needed to infer equivalence depends on the purpose of measurement (Byrne, 2008). Metric and scalar invariance are required if the goal is to compare score distributions (e.g. means), whereas metric invariance is sufficient to establish that the measured constructs can be conceptualised in the same way across groups. Accordingly, we sought to establish metric invariance to ensure that the

emotions are interpreted in the same way across the three countries.

To compare model fit for the configural, metric, and scalar invariance models, we followed recommendations by Chen (2007). To test metric invariance, a change of  $\geq - 010$  in CFI, supplemented by a change of  $\geq 015$  in RMSEA or a change of  $\geq 030$  in SRMR would indicate non- invariance. To test scalar invariance, a change of  $\geq - 010$  in CFI, supplemented by a change of  $\geq 015$  in RMSEA or a change of  $\geq 010$  in SRMR would indicate non- invariance. The configural invariance and metric invariance models showed a similar fit to the data (Supplemental Material, Table S6). The differences between these models were  $\Delta \mathsf{CFI} = - 003$ ,  $\Delta \mathsf{RMSEA} = .001$ , and  $\Delta \mathsf{SRMR} = .019$ , indicating that metric invariance could be accepted. The differences between the scalar and metric invariance models were  $\Delta \mathsf{CFI} = - 024$ ,  $\Delta \mathsf{RMSEA} = .006$ , and  $\Delta \mathsf{SRMR} = .001$ ; as such, the loss in CFI suggests that scalar invariance cannot be assumed, whereas the differences in RMSEA and SRMR would imply that scalar invariance can be accepted.

These findings confirm metric measurement invariance of the EES across groups. For scalar invariance, the evidence is mixed; this suggests that comparisons across groups that require scalar invariance, such as comparisons of mean scores, should be used cautiously. In the present research, we were interested in establishing structural measurement properties of the EES as well links with external variables, rather than comparing emotion scores across countries. The finding that the EES showed metric invariance supports this approach and suggests that the emotion constructs used in the EES are conceptually equivalent across the three countries.

# External validity

# Impact of contradictory texts on emotions

We expected participants' emotions assessed by the short scales to change across texts because the texts contained conflicting information, with Text 1 and Text 2 directly contradicting each other. Based on the hypothesis that cognitive incongruity can trigger surprise, curiosity, and confusion, we expected these emotions to increase from Text 1 to Text 2. For Text 3, we expected these emotions to return back to levels experienced during Text 1 given that no conflicting information was presented in Text 3 compared to the first two texts. As predicted, surprise and confusion significantly increased from Text 1 to Text 2, and then significantly decreased from Text 2 to Text 3 (for details, see Supplemental Material, Table S7 and Figure S1; and Muis et al., 2015). Curiosity, enjoyment, and anxiety decreased from Text 1 to Text 2, and subsequently increased from Text 2 to Text 3. Frustration and boredom significantly decreased from Text 2 to Text 3.

These findings corroborate that reading conflicting materials promotes surprise and confusion. Unexpectedly, curiosity was reduced during Text 2; however, curiosity recovered during Text 3. Similarly, Text 2 reduced participants' enjoyment, which was restored during Text 3; conversely, the negative emotions confusion, anxiety, frustration, and boredom decreased from Text 2 to Text 3. In sum, the results confirm that emotions during epistemic activities show a temporal dynamic that is aligned with the amount of text- induced cognitive incongruity, except for the decrease of curiosity from Text 1 to Text 2.

# Relations with task value and self-reported learning strategies

As expected, curiosity and enjoyment correlated positively and boredom negatively with the perceived value of the task (Table 1; Muis et al., 2015). Furthermore, surprise, curiosity, and enjoyment correlated positively with all four self- reported learning strategies; anxiety correlated positively with all of the strategies except rehearsal; confusion correlated positively with critical thinking and metacognitive self- regulation; and frustration correlated positively with critical thinking and elaboration. These findings are in line with our expectation that activating emotions can promote strategy use. They are also consistent with recent evidence suggesting that not only pleasant epistemic emotions such as enjoyment, but also unpleasant emotions such as confusion can promote learning (D'Mello et al., 2014). By contrast, in line with evidence that boredom undermines any systematic effort at learning (e.g. Pekrun, GÃ¶tz, Daniels, Stupinsky, & Perry, 2010), boredom related negatively to all four strategies. The relations were most pronounced for curiosity and boredom, respectively, thus highlighting the important role of these two emotions in epistemic contexts. In sum, the findings are consistent with our hypothesis that emotions during epistemic activities are linked to value

appraisals and strategy use during learning, thus also attesting to the external validity of the EES.

# Limitations

Due to the use of adjectives to measure emotion, it cannot fully be ruled out that respondents use the EES items to also report non- epistemic emotions that can occur during epistemic activity, such as achievement or social emotions. In a think- aloud study with 56 Canadian undergraduate students which used the same materials and procedure as the current study, the nature of the emotions occurring during reading the texts was examined (Muis et al., 2015). The findings show that the vast majority of the emotions  $(83\%)$  were epistemic. Nonetheless, scores derived from the EES should be interpreted cautiously and with reference to the specific instructions and epistemic context provided for answering the instrument. Also, the instrument measures major epistemically- related emotions but does not cover all types of these emotions. Future research could expand upon the present research by constructing additional scales for emotions that occur less frequently in epistemic contexts and are not included in the EES (e.g. awe and admiration).

# Conclusion

The present research shows that the EES are reliable and can be used to examine a range of major emotions that occur during epistemic activities. The findings also contribute support for the internal and external validity of the measure. Future research should further validate the EES by including more male participants, samples from other age groups and cultures not considered here, and multiple types of cognitive tasks, such as problem- solving tasks or contradictory texts on less familiar topics about which participants do not have existing opinions. As compared with alternative methods such as think- aloud protocols, physiological measures, or behavioural observation, the instrument is easy to administer, cost- effective, and minimally task- invasive in terms of keeping interruption of ongoing activities to a minimum. As noted at the outset, epistemic emotions are critically important for cognitive learning, problem solving, and the generation of knowledge, which suggests that researchers across disciplines should attend to these emotions. The present findings proffer the EES as one promising method that can be used to explore these emotions.
