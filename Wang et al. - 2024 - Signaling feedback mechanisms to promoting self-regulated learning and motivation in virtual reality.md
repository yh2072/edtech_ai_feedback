# ABSTRACT

Virtual reality (VR) provides a unique platform for interactive learning experiences, enhancing learning, particularly in hands- on courses. However, the visual load of VR and the lack of guidance and interaction from physical teachers or peers can pose challenges for learners in self- regulated learning (SRL) and learning motivation. This study designed feedback in the VR learning environment based on the signaling principles of Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) to investigate learners' SRL, learning motivation, cognitive levels, and their abilities to handle real- world scenarios. We developed a VR hands- on learning course on the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AloT) and conducted two real- world AloT hands- on tasks, implementing a quasi- experimental study with 71 university students. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group received three types of feedback signals (gaze, progress, and decision) designed based on signaling principles, while the control group received no feedback. The results showed that the experimental group exhibited significantly higher levels of SRL and learning motivation compared to the control group after VR learning. The feedback group also performed better in terms of cognitive levels and real- world hands- on tasks.

# 1. Introduction

With the advancement of technology, the application of virtual reality (VR) in the field of education is becoming increasingly widespread, particularly in areas such as hands- on training, programming, and AloT, where it has demonstrated tremendous potential (Lai et al., 2021; Merchant et al., 2014). Through VR, various simulated learning environments can be created to facilitate learning activities or training (W. S. Wang, Cheng, et al., 2023). By immersing themselves in highly interactive and immersive learning environments, students can augment their interest and effectiveness in learning (Tsirulnikov et al., 2023). VR also offers a secure and flexible experimental space for students to perform experiments and virtual tasks, thereby further deepening their comprehension of scientific knowledge (W. S. Wang, Cheng, et al., 2023). Moreover, the interactivity of VR empowers students to directly observe and manipulate objects in the virtual world, enhancing their engagement and hands- on practical skills in learning.

Learning through VR constitutes a form of self- regulated learning (SRL) (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012). Within a VR environment, students can independently explore and learn at their own pace, aligned with their personal interests (Radianti et al., 2020). This learning approach fosters active student engagement, self- regulation of the learning process, and amplifies their problem- solving skills and practical aptitude (Ambaryani & Putranta, 2022). SRL grants students greater autonomy, enabling them to engage in learning with keen interest and enthusiasm, consequently enhancing learning efficiency and outcomes. Furthermore, SRL augments students' motivation and equips them with the ability to confront real- world scenarios (Sitzmann & Ely, 2011). By embracing SRL, students can attain novel knowledge and skills without relying on external assistance. Hence, VR- based learning is recognized as an efficacious instrument for SRL, particularly in hands- on practical training courses.

Despite the numerous advantages of implementing SRL through VR, there are still some shortcomings in the process of SRL within VR learning environments. One significant issue is that students may become disoriented and trapped in a trial- and- error cycle in the VR environment without the guidance of peers or teachers, resulting in ineffective learning outcomes (Radianti et al., 2020). Additionally, students may experience a sense of isolation in the VR learning environment due to the absence of immediate interpersonal interactions, which can diminish their motivation to learn and dampen their desire to engage in the learning process (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012). Furthermore, since SRL in VR typically necessitates students to self- regulate their learning progress and goals, it places greater demands on their self- regulation abilities (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012). Insufficient in these abilities may lead to suboptimal learning outcomes and potentially impact students' motivation and practical abilities.

The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) provides a theoretical foundation for multimedia learning and proposes a series of design principles to optimize multimedia learning environments (Mayer & Mayer, 2005). This theory elucidates how individuals process and comprehend information conveyed through images and text. According to CTML, when learning multimedia content, individuals engage in three essential cognitive processes: selection, organization, and integration. Hence, the underpinnings of CTML hold particular significance within VR learning environments, given the immersive nature of VR that allows learners to encounter complex visual stimuli. Learners may be susceptible to various attention- distracting elements, resulting in diminished learning efficiency. Nevertheless, the signaling principle in CTML suggests that learners' attention within the learning environment can be guided through appropriate design strategies (Mayer & Fiorella, 2014). Thus, harnessing the signaling principle to formulate feedback strategies holds the potential to sustain learners' focus during the SRL process in VR and direct their attention toward the most crucial learning information, thereby fostering learning (Mayer et al., 2001).

On the other hand, feedback plays a crucial role in SRL. Appropriate feedback has the potential to enhance students' learning motivation and strengthen their SRL abilities (Theobald & Bellhauser, 2022). Through clear feedback, students can comprehend their learning progress, thereby enhancing their SRL abilities and learning motivation (Shute, 2008). Furthermore, feedback aids students in developing a clearer understanding of their learning goals and current learning status, enabling them to more effectively plan and adjust their learning strategies (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). This level of feedback clarity holds particular importance in SRL as students in this learning mode assume responsibility for their own learning processes. In the realm of VR education, a study suggests that targeted and timely feedback can stimulate students' learning motivation and help sustain their interest in exploring knowledge during independent learning processes (Radianti et al., 2020). However, current research in VR education lacks a focused approach towards integrating feedback mechanisms to enhance students' SRL abilities and learning motivation. While there are studies investigating the application of VR in hands- on practice (Dong et al., 2022; Shankhwar & Smith, 2022), few of them explore how to integrate feedback mechanisms into VR learning environments to enhance students' learning motivation and SRL abilities (Radianti et al., 2020). Moreover, these studies often overlook learners' application abilities in the real- world following VR learning, which may not guarantee effective learning within the VR environment.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the need for further research on VR learning environments, specifically focusing on the application of feedback mechanisms to enhance students' SRL capabilities and learning motivation, thereby fostering the development of practical skills and the transfer of knowledge and skills acquired in VR to real- world scenarios. To achieve this goal, feedback signals were generated based on the signaling principle within a AIoT VR hands- on learning environment to support learners in improving their learning motivation and SRL. Additionally, real- world AIoT hands- on tasks were designed to evaluate learners' abilities upon completion of VR learning. This study addresses three research questions:

This study addresses three research questions:

1. Does the incorporation of feedback mechanisms in VR enhance students' SRL abilities? 
2. Does the utilization of feedback mechanisms in VR enhance students' learning motivation? 
3. Can the integration of feedback mechanisms in VR enhance their cognitive levels of learning and abilities in real-world hands-on tasks?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Learning feedback

Learning feedback plays a crucial role in education. Hattie and Timperley (2007) define learning feedback as the provision of information that helps bridge the gap between current understanding and desired expectations or goals. This feedback can originate from external sources, such as teachers or peers, as well as from internal self- assessment. The provision of feedback brings distinct advantages to the learning environment. Firstly, it offers students real- time feedback on their learning progress, allowing them to understand areas where they excel and areas that need improvement (Shute, 2008). Furthermore, recent research indicates that feedback can enhance students' learning motivation and contribute to the development of SRL strategies (Theobald & Bellhauser, 2022). Conversely, a learning environment without feedback may present disadvantages, as the absence of feedback can hinder students from obtaining a comprehensive understanding of their learning performance and how to enhance it (Panadero & Lipnevich, 2022). Furthermore, in a learning environment, when learners encounter obstacles or difficulties without receiving timely feedback, it may diminish their learning motivation as they might feel confused and uncertain about whether they are on the correct learning path (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Overall, the application of learning feedback in VR learning environments demonstrates its potential value because learners in VR often lack the assistance of peers or teachers, thereby making feedback assistance even more crucial in this context. By providing feedback, VR can create a more interactive and engaging learning environment while addressing the challenges associated with a lack of feedback.

# 2.2. Self-regulated learning

SRL abilities play a crucial role in students' learning processes (Pintrich, 2004; Zimmerman, 2002), especially in VR learning environments. In the VR learning context, students primarily rely on their SRL abilities to guide and regulate their learning processes, making the consideration of SRL abilities an integral part of VR learning. However, research has found that students with weaker SRL abilities may encounter greater difficulties in VR learning environments, as they struggle to effectively regulate their learning without guidance (Schraw et al., 2006). This can result in reduced learning outcomes and practical skills, along with challenges in sustaining their focus on learning. In such cases, learning feedback can provide crucial support for SRL (Theobald & Bellhauser, 2022). Timely and specific feedback can help students comprehend their learning outcomes and adjust their learning strategies. This feedback holds particular importance for students with weaker SRL abilities, as it assists them in more effectively self- regulating their learning and improving their learning outcomes. Despite the widely recognized and applied potential of VR in various practical courses (Radianti et al., 2020), current VR research on training or practical courses has not yet focused on students' SRL

abilities (Albus & Seufert, 2023; Lin & Sumardani, 2023; Merchant et al., 2014; W.- S. Wang, Lin, et al., 2023). This study aims to investigate the impact of hands- on learning in VR on SRL abilities and learning outcomes through feedback.

# 2.2.1. Learning motivation

The importance of learning motivation in VR's SRL environment cannot be ignored. Learning motivation is considered a primary driving force for learners and has a profound impact on their learning outcomes and continuous learning (Ryan & Deci, 2000). However, when considering the visual load in VR learning contexts, maintaining learners' motivation becomes even more crucial. The visual load of VR has the potential to decrease learners' motivation. Excessive visual stimuli may lead to fatigue or overload, thereby diminishing their interest and concentration in learning and even interrupting the learning process (Makransky et al., 2019).

Therefore, it is crucial to maintain learners' learning motivation in VR environments to achieve effective learning outcomes. One possible strategy is to provide appropriate interventions, such as feedback, in the VR learning environment. Researchers have indicated that effective feedback can enhance learners' learning motivation and outcomes in practical courses (Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Hsia et al., 2023). The application of feedback in emerging learning environments like VR can potentially yield similar effects. Thus, this study aims to investigate the impact of feedback on learning in VR and its influence on learning motivation.

# 2.3. CTML in VR learning environments

The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) has emerged as a fundamental theory in the field of learning science. This theory, initially proposed by Mayer et al. (2001), primarily emphasizes the effective organization and presentation of multimedia information to enhance learning.

CTML delineates various essential design principles, among which the signaling principle holds significance. The signaling principle posits that by emphasizing or highlighting crucial information, learners' attention can be directed, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of the learning environment and enhancing learning outcomes (Mayer & Moreno, 2003). The application of this principle is particularly illuminating in the context of VR learning environments.

VR learning environments provide a unique multimedia learning platform that integrates visual, auditory, and other sensory elements, creating a highly immersive and interactive learning experience. However, this environment may also lead to attention distractions or cognitive overload for learners (Albus & Seufert, 2023; Makransky et al., 2019). In such cases, the signaling principle of CTML can be effective.

Feedback designed based on the signaling principle can effectively guide learners' attention in VR learning environments and prevent them from getting lost in the abundance of multimedia information. For example, learners can receive feedback through strong visual or auditory cues when completing a task (Albus & Seufert, 2023; Mayer & Moreno, 2003). This feedback approach not only helps learners focus on important learning information but also enhances their learning outcomes and motivation (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Existing research has successfully applied CTML in VR learning environments (Albus & Seufert, 2023; W.- S. Wang, Lin, et al., 2023). However, these studies seem to have overlooked how to utilize feedback designed based on CTML to address learners' SRL abilities and motivation, indicating an important research gap.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Participants and experimental design

We collected data from 71  $(N = 71)$  undergraduate participants ranging from the first to fourth year. The experimental design of this study adopted a quasi- experimental design, with participants

randomly assigned to the control group  $(n = 35)$  and the experimental group  $(n = 36)$ . They engaged in learning activities in VR environments with and without using feedback in VR learning environments, respectively. In the VR learning environment with using feedback, participants received learning feedback messages in VR, while participants in the control group did not receive any feedback assistance. As dependent variables of the study, we measured participants' learning performance after completing VR learning, including cognitive levels (differentiated into remember, understand, and apply), real- world hands- on task abilities (differentiated into Solderless breadboard operation task (SBOt) and Component function programming task (CFPt)), SRL abilities, and learning motivation. As potential covariates, we considered prior knowledge, SRL abilities, and learning motivation.

# 3.2. The AIoT VR learning environment

The learning materials in this study encompass an AIoT course, which covers fundamental knowledge of AIoT hardware, principles, programming syntax, and usage. The course focuses on the application of basic components in AIoT, such as Solderless breadboard, IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, Python knowledge, and usage.

In the VR learning environment, we designed learning tasks based on Bloom's taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002) (Table 1) and divided the content into three stages. The first stage introduces AIoT hardware knowledge and principles (Figure 1), incorporating a quiz in VR to assess participants' readiness for the subsequent learning tasks. The second stage focuses on fundamental knowledge of Python programming, covering program usage, logical reasoning, and control component parameters. The final stage involves the integration of programming with AIoT hardware, enabling

participants to accurately control the hardware through their programming (Figure 2). Recognizing that participants lack a physical keyboard in the VR environment and that programming in VR may pose additional challenges, we designed programming blocks in the Blockly format for participants to utilize (Figure 3). This approach simplifies the programming process, requiring participants only to memorize program usage and logic, facilitating the seamless implementation of desired functionalities. In the learning involving programming, participants only need to move the Blockly programming blocks we designed by dragging them. These blocks encompass program elements such as Model, Variable, Number, and Formula, allowing participants to easily complete programming tasks.

The system architecture diagram of the AIoT VR Learning Environment is depicted in Figure 4. Upon entering the AIoT VR Learning Environment, participants gain immediate access to the first learning stage: the AIoT Hardware unit. Within this unit, each learning task aligns with a

corresponding test unit. Subsequent to the completion of a learning task, participants seamlessly transition to the associated test unit. This sequential process continues until all learning tasks and test units are successfully accomplished. Subsequently, upon the completion of all tasks and test units, the AloT VR Learning Environment advances to the second stage, known as the Python Programming unit. Likewise, each programming task is paired with a corresponding test unit, and this pattern persists until all tasks and test units are completed. Finally, the environment reaches the final stage, designated as AloT Hardware and Programming unit.

In the experiments of this study, both the control group and the experimental group underwent the same AloT course in a VR learning environment, which included identical learning materials,

learning tasks, and test units. In the control group, participants did not receive any feedback messages from the VR learning environment during their participation in the learning tasks and test units.

In the experimental group using the VR learning environment with feedback, we designed three types of feedback based on the signaling principle to provide to the participants.

First, Gaze Feedback: When participants linger or do not click on any learning material in the VR environment, we display prominent cues on the components or programming blocks used in that unit (Figure 5). In all learning stages, the AloT VR learning environment monitors the learner's screen. If a learner remains inactive, without moving the VR HMD or interacting with any learning materials within the environment for more than  $15s$ , it triggers an Gaze Feedback. Additionally, to address the potential brevity of the 15- second duration, learners have the option to decide whether or not to accept assistance from Gaze Feedback when it is triggered.

Second, Progress Feedback: This feedback informs participants about the current progress of the task and provides feedback upon completion of their responses or actions (Figure 6). Throughout all learning stages, Progress Feedback is delivered to learners through a dashboard that visually presents their learning progress. This dashboard displays the progress of all ongoing learning tasks or test units, clearly highlighting completed items to aid learners in tracking their learning advancement.

Third, Decision Feedback: Since we included simple knowledge assessment questions after each learning task to measure participants' completion of the stage and their readiness for the next task, in this type of feedback, we provide different responses based on the correctness of their answers. Firstly, Correct Feedback is provided, followed by Incorrect Feedback. When participants receive Incorrect Feedback, they are required to redo the learning task (Figure 7). Additionally, in AloT programming tasks, decision feedback also provides programming feedback. For example, if participants incorrectly match programming blocks or set parameters beyond the specified range (overflow, illegal parameters), they will receive corresponding feedback.

In the real- world hands- on tasks, we divided them into two stages: the Solderless breadboard Operation task (SBOt) and the Component function programming task (CFPt) (Figure 8). Participants must complete the SBOt before proceeding to the CFPt. The learning tasks involve assembling AloT hardware and programming it to ensure proper functioning.

# 3.3. Questionnaires and measures

The participants in this study completed the online questionnaire provided by us. Prior knowledge was assessed through ten open- ended questions, which were developed and evaluated by two domain experts to ensure the validity of the test. The questions included four remember items, three understand items, and three apply items (e.g. "What is a Solderless breadboard?"). The total score was 100. To ensure the reliability of the questions, two domain experts determined the inter- rater reliability  $(r = .88, p < .001)$ .

For learning outcomes, two domain experts collaboratively developed ten open- ended questions pertaining to AloT hardware and programming knowledge in order to assess the participants' cognitive levels. To gain a better understanding of the participants' cognitive processes during VR learning, we categorized the cognitive levels based on Bloom's taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002). This categorization comprised four remember questions (e.g. What does the red "+" symbol represent on a Solderless breadboard?), three understand questions (e.g. Provide a shortcode example that demonstrates repetition using "n + 1" as a function.), and three apply questions (e.g. What syntax and components can be utilized to achieve blinking functionality?). In response to these questions, learners were required to recall, comprehend, and apply the knowledge they had acquired. Each item

was scored on a scale of 1- 10, with a total score of 100. On the other hand, for the real- world handson tasks, two domain experts assessed the SBO and CFP tasks by evaluating completeness, completion time, and functional accuracy. Each task had a maximum score of 50, resulting in a total score of 100. Similarly, to ensure the reliability of the questions, two domain experts determined the inter- rater reliability  $(r = .81$ $p < .001$  -

SRL abilities were measured using an adapted version of the MSLQ scale developed by Pintrich (1991). We employed the following components from the MSLQ: Self- Efficacy for Learning and Performance (2 items) from the Expectancy component, Organization (2 items) from Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies, Metacognitive Self- Regulation (2 items) from Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies, and Effort Regulation (2 items) from Resource Management Strategies. The scale employed a five- point Likert scale, where I indicated "strongly disagree" and S indicated "strongly agree". It consisted of eight items (e.g. I believe I can perform well on assignments and tests related to AIoT.). The Cronbach's a value for this questionnaire was 0.833.

The learning motivation was collected using an adapted version of the learning motivation scale developed by Wang and Chen (2010). This scale utilizes a five- point Likert scale, where 1 represents "strongly disagree" and 5 represents "strongly agree". It consists of six items (e.g. I prefer learning materials that challenge me because it allows me to learn new things). The Cronbach's a value for this questionnaire was 0.823.

# 3.4.Procedure

3.4. ProcedureThe data for this study were collected at a university in southern Taiwan. Participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the experiment at any time, and they were assured that their academic performance would not be affected. They were required to wear a VR Head Mounted Display (HMD) during the experiment for engaging in the learning activities. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 9.

![](images/4ed5c6514d189278a5b931e86872edbba3543d6a26dca915d5e32d622403ac36.jpg)  
Figure 9. Experiment procedure of this study.

Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. After completing an online questionnaire that assessed prior knowledge and demographic information, six teaching assistants provided instructions on the VR equipment and delivered a brief course introduction to all participants. They assisted participants in wearing the HMD and ensuring its comfortable positioning to minimize any interruptions caused by device- related issues. The experiment then commenced. Participants were tasked with completing three learning units, each comprising multiple learning tasks. To alleviate potential discomfort from prolonged HMD usage, we limited each learning unit to 25 min and divided them over three weeks. Following the completion of all VR learning units, participants were asked to perform two real- world AIoT hands- on tasks. Subsequently, participants completed post- test questionnaires that assessed cognition levels, learning motivation, and SRL abilities. Additionally, two domain experts evaluated the scores of all participants' real- world AIoT hands- on tasks. The overall questionnaires completion and Real- world AIoT Hands- on tasks assessment process took approximately 30 min.

# 4. Results

We conducted Levene's tests to assess the homogeneity of variances for each variable, and the results indicated that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was not violated (Overall learning cognitive levels:  $F = .327$ ,  $p = .511$ ; SRL abilities:  $F = .62$ ,  $p = .127$ ; Learning motivation:  $F = 0.362$ ,  $p = 0.317$ ). This suggests that the variances across groups were equal, allowing us to include prior knowledge, learning motivation, and SRL abilities (as covariates) in the ANCOVA analysis.  $t$ - tests were used to examine whether there were differences in the performance of the hands- on tasks (SBOt and CFPt) between the two groups of participants.

# 4.1. SRL and learning motivation

The results of SRL abilities and learning motivation for the two groups are presented in Table 2. The pre- test of SRL abilities did not have a significant effect on SRL abilities itself, but there were significant differences in SRL abilities between the two groups. Similarly, the pretest of learning motivation did not have a significant effect on learning motivation itself, but there were significant differences in learning motivation between the two groups. These findings suggest that both groups of students exhibited improvements in a SRL abilities and learning motivation after engaging in VR learning. Specifically, the participants in the experimental group demonstrated significantly higher levels of learning motivation and SRL abilities compared to the control group, likely due to the utilization of VR feedback.

The learning cognition levels and real- world hands- on task abilities of the experimental and control groups are presented in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. The participants' prior knowledge (including overall cognition levels, remember, understanding, and apply levels) did not significantly affect

their overall cognition levels, remember, understanding, and apply levels. However, significant differences were observed in these variables between the two groups. These findings indicate that all participants who engaged in VR learning activities demonstrated significant improvements in their cognition levels. Furthermore, the experimental group, which received VR feedback, exhibited significantly higher cognition levels compared to the control group.

In the two real- world hands- on tasks, the group that received feedback outperformed the control group in both SBO and CFP tasks (Figure 10). These results suggest that the utilization of feedback in the VR learning environment can enhance participants' abilities in real- world hands- on tasks.

# 5. Discussion

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of designing feedback in VR learning environments based on the signaling principle of CTML on students' learning motivation, SRL abilities, learning cognition levels, and real- world hands- on tasks abilities.

# 5.1. Effects of signaling feedback on SRL and learning motivation

This study aimed to investigate the impact of using feedback in a VR learning environment for training AloT hands- on tasks on learners' SRL abilities and learning motivation (Research Questions 1 and 2). Our research findings are consistent with the studies conducted by Zimmerman (2002) and Hattie and Timperley (2007), which emphasize the crucial role of feedback in the SRL process. Specifically, in the VR environment, our designed feedback types (gaze, progress, and decision feedback) provide significant support and assistance to participants in an isolated VR learning environment where is no teacher or peer assistance. Moreover, Albus and Seufert (2023) have observed that visual load in VR can lead to additional cognitive burdens, resulting in cognitive overload and potential interruptions or learning failures. However, our gaze feedback helps participants reduce retrieval time in the VR environment, thereby mitigating visual load. This may also contribute to their higher SRL abilities and learning motivation.

On the other hand, Panadero and Lipnevich (2022) have pointed out that providing guided feedback in learning environments can enhance SRL abilities. Feedback allows learners to fully understand what they have learned and track their progress. This feedback can come from external or internal sources, such as teachers, peers, and learning materials (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Therefore, the progress and decision feedback we provide are precisely designed to support the VR environment where there is no teachers or peers assistance available. It enables learners to have an immediate understanding of their learning progress and make appropriate adjustments, thus enhancing their SRL abilities. Additionally, in our VR learning environment, learning takes place through highly interactive learning materials, which sets it apart from some previous VR studies (Albus & Seufert, 2023; Lai et al., 2021) that only presented non- interactive video materials. Through our learning materials and the feedback mechanisms we have designed, we stimulate higher learning motivation in participants, aligning with the claim made by Hattie and Timperley (2007) that interaction and feedback can effectively promote learning motivation.

# 5.2. Effects of signaling feedback on learning cognitive levels and hands-on tasks abilities

To investigate research question 3 and gain a deeper insight into the participants' levels of learning cognition, we categorized them into remember, understanding, and apply levels. Furthermore, we evaluated their abilities in two AloT real- world hands- on tasks to examine the potential influence of signaling feedback in the VR environment. Our findings revealed that all participants exhibited significant enhancements in their cognition levels following VR learning, with the group receiving feedback in VR demonstrating higher cognition levels and real- world hands- on tasks abilities.

Hattie and Timperley (2007) emphasized the impact of feedback on the learning process. Particularly in the VR environment, real- time feedback can enhance learners' remember and understanding abilities and improve their capacity to apply acquired knowledge to real- world scenarios. In our study, the significant enhancement in cognitive and hans- on abilities observed in the experimental group can be attributed to the rich and intuitive information provided through feedback in VR, facilitating learners' internalization of knowledge and practical application. This finding aligns with the findings of Kirschner et al. (2006), highlighting that effective feedback can provide learners with specific guidance, thereby enhancing hans- on abilities.

Compared to previous VR studies on hands- on learning (Dong et al., 2022; Shankhwar & Smith, 2022), we offered more comprehensive feedback guidance, enabling learners to gain more during the cognitive process. Additionally, in the AloT programming learning process, we designed a VR programming environment using Blockly. Learners can easily program by memorizing and understanding the logic and usage of programming. In contrast to prior VR studies that focused on teaching AloT knowledge without participants engaging in programming and without evaluating

their performance in real- world scenarios (Lai et al., 2021), our approach not only provided VR- based programming training but also assessed participants' abilities to handle real- world hands- on tasks following VR learning. This evaluation validated the effectiveness of the VR learning process.

# 6. Conclusions

This study provides compelling evidence that designing and implementing signaling feedback in VR, based on the CTML, effectively enhances learners' SRL abilities, learning motivation, cognitive levels (including remember, understanding, and apply levels), and real- world AloT hands- on abilities. The research findings not only confirm the crucial role of feedback in improving learning outcomes but also demonstrate the distinctive and effective platform that VR technology provides for facilitating feedback in the learning process.

Through precise experimental design and implementation, our study emphasizes the importance of appropriate feedback in VR learning environments. We found that real- time and targeted feedback (gaze, progress, and decision) significantly enhance learners' SRL abilities, learning motivation, and cognitive abilities. Furthermore, we discovered that through VR feedback, learners can more effectively apply their acquired knowledge to hands- on tasks, thereby enhancing their hands- on abilities.

This study also has some limitations, including the duration of the learning units and the design of feedback. By increasing the duration of the learning units, the improvement in learners' cognitive abilities can be better emphasized. For instance, increasing the diversity and complexity of the learning units would enable learners to construct knowledge more comprehensively. Furthermore, there are numerous other principles in CTML that can be applied in VR learning environments, such as the principles of coherence, redundancy, segmenting and spatial. These principles offer significant potential for VR learning environments to provide learners with a more comfortable and comprehensive learning experience. In our research, we only explored the signaling principles used in feedback design. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on developing longer learning units and applying a broader range of CTML principles in VR learning environments to further explore the potential of VR learning.
